## Agenda

> **Guidelines**
> - To cover everything, discussion may be time-constrained. Topics that require less time should be covered first. Most topics take 15-30 minutes.
> - Include any and all relevant links (RFC, issues & PRs, presentations). If there are no relevant links, open an issue to provide context and link to that.
> - Read the [spec contribution guide](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

-->

1. Introduction of attendees (5m, Lee)
1. Agree to Specification Membership Agreement and Code of Conduct (1m, Lee)
   - [Specification Membership Agreement](https://github.com/graphql/foundation)
   - [Participation Guidelines](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg#participation-guidelines)
   - [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/graphql/foundation/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

1. Review agenda (2m, Lee)
1. Review previous meeting's action items? (Skipped due to agenda coverage) (5m, Lee)
1. Update on Spec freeze and 2020 release schedule (5m, Lee)
1. Custom Scalar Specification URIs Update (10m, Matt Farmer)
   - Waiting for `graphql-js` `15.0.0` to be cut.  Scheduled to be included in `15.1.0` which would be released a week or two later.  [Relevant Discussion](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2276#discussion_r367909160).
   - Seeking validation on how to handle use-case where a scalar is extended multiple times, which results in the directive being included in the `typeExtensionsMap` multiple times.  Currently taking the last element.
       - [Test Case](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2276/files#r364908343)
       - [Relevant Source code](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2276/files#diff-a2222d77ff884acdf97c5f295babf27cR333-R340)
   - [Custom Scalar Specification URIs RFC Issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/635)
   - [Custom Scalar Specification URIs RFC PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/649)
   - [GraphQL.js PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2276/files)
1. Discuss deprecation of input fields. There was an older PR (https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/525) which seems abandonded. Are there any blocker to move this forward? (15min, Andi)
1. Discuss full unicode support. There was a PR (https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/231) which was never merged. GraphQL Java and GraphQL Ruby and probably more implementation support full unicode support already. What are the challenges here? (15min, Andi)
1. Discuss backwards compatible introspection: the spec is about to add two new introspection fields (`isRepeatable` and `specifiedBy`) to Introspection. Together with `description` it becomes increasily difficult for clients to query the full Introspection data. Should there be a more general solution? (15min, Andi)
1. Discuss @defer and @stream [strawman proposal and questions in the comment](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/679) (30m, Kewei, Jafar, Jennifer)
1.  I'd like to get an idea of what people want from the website redesign (10m, Orta)
