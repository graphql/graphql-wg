<!--

Hello! You're welcome to join our working group meeting and add to the agenda
by following these three steps:

   1. Add your name to the list of attendees (in alphabetical order).

      - To respect meeting size, attendees should be relevant to the agenda.
        That means we expect most who join the meeting to participate in
        discussion. If you'd rather just watch, check out our YouTube[1].

      - Please include the organization (or project) you represent, and the
        location (including country code[2]) you expect to be located in during
        the meeting.

      - If you're willing to help take notes, add "✏️" after your name
        (eg. Ada Lovelace ✏). This is hugely helpful!

   2. If relevant, add your topic to the agenda (sorted by expected time).

      - Every agenda item has four parts: 1) the topic, 2) an expected time
        constraint, 3) who's leading the discussion, and 4) a list of any
        relevant links (RFC docs, issues, PRs, presentations, etc). Follow the
        format of existing agenda items.

      - Know what you want to get out of the agenda topic - what feedback do you
        need? What questions do you need answered? Are you looking for consensus
        or just directional feedback?

      - If your topic is a new proposal it's likely an "RFC 0"[3]. The barrier
        of entry for documenting new proposals is intentionally low, writing a
        few sentences about the problem you're trying to solve and the rough
        shape of your proposed solution is normally sufficient.

        You can create a link for this:
          - As an issue against the graphql-wg repo.
          - As a GitHub discussion in the graphql-wg repo.
          - As an RFC document into the rfcs/ folder of the graphql-wg repo.

   3. Review our guidelines and agree to our Spec Membership & CLA.

      - Review and understand our Spec Membership Agreement, Participation &
        Contribution Guidelines, and Code of Conduct. You'll find links to these
        in the first agenda item of every meeting.

      - If this is your first time, our bot will comment on your Pull Request
        with a link to our Spec Membership & CLA. Please follow along and agree
        before your PR is merged.

        Your organization may sign this for all of its members. To set this up,
        please ask operations@graphql.org.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

  - By joining this meeting you must agree to the Specification Membership
    Agreement and Code of Conduct.

  - Meetings are recorded and made available on YouTube[1], by joining you
    consent to being recorded.

1. Introduction of attendees (5m, Lee)
1. Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Lee)
1. Review agenda (2m, Lee)
1. Review previous meeting's action items (5m, Lee)
   - [Ready for review](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Ready+for+review+%F0%9F%99%8C%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
   - [All open action items (by last update)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Action+item+%3Aclapper%3A%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
   - [All open action items (by meeting)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc)
1. Discuss new intersection type proposal (15m, Yaacov)
   - Alternative to unions implementing interfaces discussed at last WG
   - spec PR: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/941
   - graphql-js PR: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3550
   - discussion: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/944
1. Defer/Stream
   - asynchronous iterators of iterables versus of items, continuation of last WG meeting (15m, Yaacov)
     - Should resolvers returning AsyncIterables returning AsyncIterables of items or AsyncIterables of Iterables of items? 
     - Should the AsyncGenerator returned by graphql-js yield items singly or yield all available items (in array or otherwise)? 
     - Background: https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/38
     - See above link for polls, still waiting for feedback explaining votes.
   - Stream Payload index format (10m, Rob)
     - https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/39
1. CCN status update and rollout plans (10m, Alex Reilly)
1. `@oneof` - time to promote to RFC2? (20m, Benjie)
   - [Spec PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/825)
   - [graphql.js PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3513) (thanks @erikkessler1)
   - Main hesitation: should we mirror `@oneof` in the output types (i.e. `type Foo @oneof { ... }`)
     - If yes: what does this mean for unions?
     - If yes: should we spec this a little before merging the input-only `@oneof`?
     - If no: is it desirable that input polymorphism and output polymorphism is so different?
