# GraphQL WG Meeting #2 Notes (October 27, 2017)

[Agenda](../agendas/2017-10-27.md)

* Review current Draft for ["Stages for changes to the GraphQL Specification"]
* Provides greater visibility to what is happening
* Clarity on how to get something into the spec / how to start
* Unlike TC-39, stages start at -2
* Not sure if ideal to have lockstep between spec and graphql-js
* JavaScript stages have been successful because of the babel transforms
   * Can use next stage ideas early (JavaScript)
   * Is is possible to add to the library under a flag?
* Want to allow for experimentation with the language
* May be valuable for a global test suite to verify spec
* [GraphQL CATS](https://github.com/graphql-cats/graphql-cats)
   * Lack of error codes makes it hard to validate implementation
   * How can we assert on different error solutions
   * Having official return value for validation failure / prescribed errors
   * Follow up on errors in later agenda item
* Negative numbers may make it hard to determine when an item is officially in a proposal status
* Documentation of process is easier to adopt for community
* Living document
* Would be valuable to have a proposal list
   * Stage sorted and possible implementation examples
   * Possible process for Champion identification and re championing it
* Versioning the spec makes it easier to determine what level of support servers implement
   * Version is be the release date
   * Already in practice with spec website
   * What does semver / major + minor change versions look like?
      * A lot more ambiguous
      * Small for one could be large for another tool
      * Probably not a good idea for spec
* Very little potential difference between stage 3 changes and the formal spec
   * Having a regular schedule is important
   * Some implementors won’t implement “working” spec features, only official spec
* Spec should be trailing indicator of libraries
* Need to add feature grid and formally recommend stage 3 as part of the implementation spec
* Not it is most useful to provide explanation of process and even add labels of status




* Discuss status of IDL specification
* Not a lot has happened from the last meeting
* Feedback on both spec and implementation need to be followed up on
* Want to get in before cutting the 2017 additions
* SDL is an IDL, so both terms are valid
* SDL is the recommended approach
* Champion? Lee?


* Status of [Scalar serialize as built-in scalar type](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/326) RFC
* Need a clear champion
* Clear path forward through stages and just be picked back up
* Let’s use the current stage process outlined above as a test case




* Discuss interest in and possible scope of defining a more structured format for errors
* Useful for client usage
* Graphcool has done this well
* Distinction between validation and parsing errors
* Agreeing on execution error tagging
* Want to be able to return an error and a fallback value
   * May need to be an additional discussion
   * A try / catch implementation
* General agreement on value of returning error and value
* Not sure of high confidence of internal Facebook’s error handling to use as spec
* What are the most important problems to solve first?
* Multiple small proposals
* Do we want to “require” error process in favor of predictability over flexibility
   * In the very least validation vs parsing errors
   * Word it as “may” in the spec to encourage, but not require
   * Could provide value for common implementations that aren’t required (optional spec)
* If we have a CATS style validation process that could include optional errors
* Improving structure would be valuable
* Call out the flexibility of the current errors spec
* Would be great to know usage patterns at Facebook
   * Also collect external information
* Martijn as champion of this process
   * Initial proposal
   * Further use cases
* Extend the errors into the type system
   * SDL defined errors
* Possibly two proposals?
   * Common fields
   * Long term solution / error type system
* Typed errors are more indicative of language usage
   * Reuse __typename?
   * Extend introspection into error documentation
   * Could use a fragment against an error to pull back certain types?
   * Or should we return all fields since they are typically out of bounds?






* Update on community projects around schema stitching (Namespacing item moved here)
* Project list as of now:
   * Graphql-tools (schema stitching) (JS)
      * Merge (declaratively) / call (imperatively) others
   * GraphQL weaver (JS)
   * GraphQL Join
   * GRAMPS (slightly different in more for modular driven schemas)
   * Internal usage at some companies does like items
* Language independent merging
* What spec changes would / could be needed to improve this?
   * What makes it easier to fit together?
   * We may not need any changes?
   * Not sold on namespaces (Sashko + Lee)
      * Don’t want to push namespace to clients to have to deal with it
      * Possibly just an ergonomics change (underscore vs `:`)
      * GraphQL is commonly used as a codegen tool for many places so codegen is possible
   * Haven’t run into the issues initially thought so may not require anything
   * Keep an eye on the space
   * Need more experimentation in companies needing it
   * No need for champion / spec work now
* Could the schema expose additional meta information?
   * Directives
   * Exposing a hash of a schema?
      * To determine schema version / changes
   * Test out new ideas and report back
* META
   * Create possible spec addition repo format like TC-39 repos




* Discuss next steps for ["Standardizing unique IDs in the spec/tooling"](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/232)
* What is the smallest first step here?
* Sashko as champion
* “If you want ids, call them X and they need Y”
* Going to move forward with new repo, split and move issues, update proposal


* "GraphQL over HTTP" specification
* There is a general consensus
   * Using POST
* Could help for using things like Apollo Link outside of Apollo
* Standardization around tooling would be valuable
* Ivan is champion


* Discuss upcoming meeting schedule
* 3 month cadence is ideal
* December 8th is current planned date
