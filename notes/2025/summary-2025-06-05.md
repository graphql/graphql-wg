The meeting began with introductions and agenda discussion, focusing on topics related to AI and GraphQL, including marketing strategies and upcoming conferences. The team reviewed several GraphQL proposals and specifications, discussing changes to HTTP status codes, error handling, and schema coordinates, while also addressing updates to execution algorithms and type systems. The conversation ended with discussions about the GraphQL specification cut date and service capabilities, with the team agreeing to aim for a July 1st cut date while advancing nullability features and composite schemas.

## Summary

### Meeting Guidelines and Introductions

The meeting began with Lee welcoming attendees and reminding them of the meeting guidelines, including the recording and publishing of meetings on YouTube. Lee also mentioned the use of AI summarization tools for meeting notes. The meeting then moved to name-to-face introductions, with Lee requesting attendees to send a pull request if they were not on the agenda list.

### GraphQL and AI Integration Strategies

The meeting began with introductions and a discussion led by Lee about the agenda, which included topics such as AI and GraphQL, GraphQL over HTTP, and several RFCs. Jory introduced a topic on the role of GraphQL in the AI ecosystem, emphasizing the need for a practical and technical approach. Lee and Jory discussed potential strategies and content creation for marketing, with Lee highlighting the importance of addressing AI at GraphQLConf later in the year. Benjie then took over to discuss the GraphQL over HTTP spec, noting that it was nearly complete with one minor piece remaining.

### Partial Success HTTP Status Code

The team discussed introducing a new partial success HTTP status code (294) for GraphQL responses, as existing codes don't adequately represent partial success. Benjie explained that while the code would be non-official, it's a common pattern in HTTP extensions, and they would use it in combination with a media type to minimize potential conflicts. Lee raised concerns about compatibility with old proxies and suggested using a header-based approach instead of a status code, but Benjie noted that the team would proceed with the status code implementation while being mindful of potential compatibility issues.

### GraphQL Proposals and Updates

The team discussed several GraphQL proposals and updates. Steven reported progress on adding descriptions to executable operations, which was moved from RFC 1 to RFC 2, and he is working on implementing it in GraphQL.js. Lee mentioned that this change is on a fast track to approval once the pull request is updated. Benjie presented a bug fix for schema definitions, ensuring descriptions are not dropped when the schema keyword is excluded. The team agreed to bump this change to RFC 2 as well. Benjie also introduced a trivial editorial change to standardize the use of "assert" in algorithms. Mark briefly mentioned a proposal on schema coordinates but was interrupted by his children and asked Benjie to continue the discussion.

### Schema Syntax Dot vs Double Colon

The team discussed changes to schema coordinate syntax, specifically whether to use a dot (.) or double colon (::) to distinguish enum values from fields. While some members preferred the double colon for its precedent in other languages, the group ultimately leaned towards keeping the dot syntax to maintain consistency with existing tools and best practices, particularly since many GraphQL services follow the convention of using all caps for enum values. Lee suggested continuing the discussion on the thread and potentially reverting the recent change, while Mark offered to implement the final decision.

### GraphQL Specification Updates Review

The team discussed several proposals and RFCs related to GraphQL specifications. Mark proposed updates to the spec and implementation, which Lee supported and encouraged for conclusion. Benjie presented updates on data collection trilogy and one-off tasks, which Lee approved for merging. Rob shared progress on execution result definitions, which Lee praised for improving the type system coherence. The team celebrated the completion of default value coercion rules, which Benjie and Lee had worked on for a long time. Lee committed to reviewing and merging several proposals, including prevent skip and include on route subscription and discussion section 3 type system and execution versus request error.

### Distinction Between Request and Execution Errors

Benjie and Lee discussed the distinction between request errors and execution errors in their specification. Benjie argued that these are two different types of errors with distinct properties, while Lee suggested that there might only be one kind of error, with the type of payload determined by the phase of the operation. Pascal and Michael agreed that having specific error types could be beneficial, but emphasized that these errors would still be errors overall.

### Algorithm Naming and Error Handling

The team discussed several specification changes related to execution and error handling. Benjie and Lee agreed to rename algorithms to clarify their purpose, with "perform" being preferred over "execute" to maintain consistency with verb-noun pairings. They decided to update algorithm names like "perform query" and "perform mutation" to improve clarity. Lee suggested adding a high-level overview of the execution process near the beginning of the specification to help readers understand the sequence of operations. The team also addressed the need to disable error propagation in certain cases, with Benjie mentioning that the Nullability working group was exploring options for implementing this feature.

### Service Capabilities Proposal Discussion

The team discussed a proposal for service capabilities, which would allow servers to indicate supported features like fragment arguments and error handling through a key-value store using reverse DNS identifiers. Benjie explained that this would complement the existing type system and introspection capabilities, particularly for features that cannot be derived from introspection. The group agreed that this feature would be valuable for tooling and client generation, with Michael noting that it has been discussed for four years. While there was some discussion about implementing it as a directive in the SDL, Benjie preferred to keep it as a service-specific feature for now, with the possibility of adding SDL syntax in the future.

### GraphQL Specification Cut Date Discussion

The team discussed the GraphQL specification cut date, with Benjie proposing July 1st and Michael advocating for September 1st to include nullability features. The group agreed to aim for a July 1st cut to align with the GraphQL 10th anniversary, though Lee emphasized that the spec cut should not delay critical features. Michael highlighted the importance of including capabilities in the specification, and the team agreed to advance the nullability RFC to merge in two weeks, with composite schemas to be addressed separately.
