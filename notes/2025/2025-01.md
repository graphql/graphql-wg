## TSC Election update

- Issue:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1612](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1612)
- We’ll be closing the application process 10th of January 2025

## TSC GitHub permissions

- Some TSC members have ownership permissions
- Rather than every TSC member having ownership permissions
- Let’s save it for a different time as Lee is not here

## GraphQLConf 2025

- Amsterdam September 8 - 10 2025
- We want more community - WG involvement
- We want you to attend, tell us why and how we can help you
- There might be a working group track during what’s normally the unconference
  day
  - Working group leaders for composite schemas, … would do a talk and have
    discussions
  - Being in the same room can spark new ideas
  - Michael, good idea, having dedicated discussion time would be a great change
  - Martin, how would this work? Would it be interested people or the general
    audience?
  - Martin, workshops might be better to spark discussion
  - Michael, I thought more about user group style, champions talk about the
    topics and the current state. Then after you have time to mingle and talk to
    the people.
  - Michael, the main difference with the regular talk format is that it isn’t
    packed, we have dedicated discussion time.
  - Benjie, my idea is the champions have talks, there will be some tables and
    people can approach the tables that interest them (based on
    topics/subtopics). Discussions of 8-10 people, then people from each table
    can surface the ideas from their table to the general group.
  - Benjie, the audience is wider than the working groups, it will be a narrower
    group than the conference audience but interested people that touch on these
    topics, like folks writing GraphQL clients.
  - Jeff, there was also talk about doing working sessions
  - Benjie, introducing a slightly wider audience is the goal, this could give
    us an opportunity for a lot more feedback
  - Michael, aren’t these people involved in the working groups already? For
    example in Microsoft conferences product managers invite you to give
    feedback on their spare time.
  - Benjie, if people have more thoughts or ideas or know what works and what
    does not please reach out
- Benjie: is there anyone we should include for various topics, like subject
  matter experts that work on GraphQL clients. Anyone eager to MC, …?
  - Martin, what is the best way to reach out?
  - Benjie, Discord in the graphqlconf channel

## Changing error handling of subscription streams

- RFC
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1127](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1127)
- Benjie, we discussed this in a previous meeting. Since then we merged the
  underlying changes by Lee Byron
- Benjie, what should happen when you have a subscription and you get an error
  that happens on the underlying stream. This would be the stream-iterator
  throwing an error.
- Benjie, currently the error gets re-thrown which is very different from how
  GraphQL currently behaves as we normally return GraphQLErrors with a 200
  status code
- Benjie, rethrowing → yielding a response with errors contained within
- Martin, this would remove the last place that throws errors in GraphQL-JS
  right?
- Benjie, yes, apart from edge-cases like non-validated schema-usage
- Martin, I think this is a good change then. In Kotlin this is a big pain,
  having deterministic data structures would be a good change
- Michael, We wouldn’t prescribe a fixed test for the error, would we?
- Benjie, no, just like we don’t for any other error
- Benjie, the main question here is to move this to RFC 1
  - We meet all of the criteria for stage 1
- Michael, Yes! The current behaviour is not the user expected behaviour
- **Decision**: We move this to RFC 1

## Add ‘extensions’ to request

- RFC
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/976](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/976)
- Benjie, Should we move it to RFC 3 as the feedback is addressed
- Benjie, As Lee is not here I’ll skip this until next month

## Defer/stream update

- Editorial change for Path:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1129](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1129)
- Spec edits for Section 3:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1132](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1132)
- Rob, The above PR’s need feedback. One other thing I’ve done since the last
  meeting is reaching out to authors of GraphQL clients to have feedback on the
  response format.
- Rob, Kinda wanna get one last confirmation that the new response format is
  good! Please review the spec edits and editorial PR
- Rob, Created a new PR that only edits section three so we can review it piece
  by piece.
- Rob, This has all been implemented in GraphQL.JS - there haven’t been any
  proposed changes to this format since June 2023. The execution changes have
  settled as well.
- Benjie, is the plan to do both defer and stream side by side (referencing an
  earlier plan to first get in defer and then stream)
- Rob, that was discussed a few times but we never settled on a decision there.
  This goes forward with both stream and defer. The execution algorithm for
  stream isn't there yet.
- Benjie, I think that’s the right decision so we don’t have to change things to
  defer because we find problems with stream later.
- Benjie, is there a reason you put the argument for steam in that order
- Rob, no
- **Call to action**: Review the PRs

## Implementations may not deprecate a field that the interface hasn't deprecated

- RFC
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1053](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1053)
- Benjie, This has broad approval and Lee suggested some wording tweaks
- Benjie, For now we’ll leave this be as Stephen has requested changes.

## Fix CoerceArgumentValues()' hasValue

- RFC
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1056](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1056)
- Benjie, There’s a bad hasValue check in the specification. We aren’t
  accounting for the argumentValue being a variable, we set hasValue to true
  when there is a variable however this variable could not have been specified
- Jovi believes Benjie is 100% correct
- Benjie, can we move this to RFC2? Everyone is scratching their head so…. We’ll
  bring it back next time.
- **Call To Action**: provide reviews on
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1056](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1056)

## Be explicit about list coercion

- RFC
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1058](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1058)
- Benije, this is a bug in the GraphQL Spec. The issue happens when we provide a
  default value to the middle of a nested argument value.
- Should we push this to RFC2?
  - Resolution of challenge? Yes
  - Compliant implementation? Yes
  - Consensus? Not yet
- **Call To Action**: provide reviews on
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1058](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1058)
