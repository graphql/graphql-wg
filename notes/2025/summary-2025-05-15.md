The team reviewed several agenda items including executable definitions and error propagation, with Steven presenting an RFC for adding descriptions to executable document definitions that was moved to RFC 2 and Stephen volunteering to champion it. The group discussed implementing a capability system for GraphQL services to indicate supported features and error behaviors, with Benjie and Lee debating different approaches and naming conventions while agreeing to keep the initial implementation simple. The team also discussed the design of a service capabilities system and naming conventions for GraphQL concepts, with Benjie planning to write up a version focused on error propagation capabilities and Lee agreeing to review the proposal further.

## Next Steps

- Benjie to update the RFC for error propagation with the new capability system approach discussed.
- Lee to review and provide editorial feedback on the naming of "execute collected fields" and related terms in the spec.
- Stephen to update the working group agenda for June 5th with progress on the executable definitions RFC.
- Stephen to rebase and update the pull requests related to the executable definitions RFC.
- Benjie to explore implementing the new error propagation behavior as an optional appendix to the spec.
- Lee to further consider and provide feedback on the naming conventions for field sets and related concepts in the spec.
- Benjie to send Lee a message with additional thoughts on the nullability and error propagation implementation.

## Summary

### RFC Tracking and Prioritization

The team discussed several agenda items, including executable definitions and error propagation. Steven presented an RFC for adding descriptions to executable document definitions, which the group agreed to move to RFC 2. Stephen volunteered to take over as champion for this RFC. The team decided to prioritize getting the GraphQL.js PR merged and for Steven to report progress at the next working group meeting. Lee suggested creating an RFC tracker to help implementers follow along with upcoming changes. Benjie shared a personal RFC tracker, but the group agreed a more official system would be needed in the future.

### GraphQL Capability System Discussion

Benjie proposed a capability system for GraphQL services to indicate supported features and error behaviors. Lee expressed concerns about overcomplicating the solution and suggested using introspection to determine capabilities. They discussed the pros and cons of different approaches, including a flat list of strings and key-value pairs. The group agreed to keep the initial implementation simple, focusing on the minimum viable solution to address their current needs.

### GraphQL Service Capabilities Design

Benjie and Lee discussed the design of a service capabilities system for GraphQL. They agreed to use a list of capability objects with names and optional values, where the absence of a value would indicate a Boolean flag. They decided to use a domain-based naming convention for capabilities, with "graphql." as a prefix for internal capabilities and reverse domain notation for others. Lee suggested implementing basic validation to catch incorrect usage. They also discussed how to represent capabilities in SDL, considering a simple syntax where each service lists its capabilities. Benjie planned to write up a version focused on error propagation capabilities, which would include two main capabilities: the ability to set error behavior and the default error behavior.

### GraphQL Field Naming Convention Debate

Lee and Benjie discussed naming conventions for GraphQL concepts, particularly around the terms "field set" and "collected fields." They debated the merits of different naming approaches, with Benjie favoring "field set" due to its clarity in implementation while Lee expressed concerns about the pluralization and alignment with method names. They also touched on nullability and error propagation, with Benjie proposing a transitional approach that would allow for both new services with error propagation turned off and compatibility with existing systems. Lee agreed to review the proposal further.
