The GraphQL Working Group meeting covered several key topics, including updates to schema coordinates, reorganization of the specification, and discussions on various RFC proposals. The group reviewed and approved changes to improve consistency in schema definitions and addressed longstanding issues in the specification. Throughout the meeting, participants focused on aligning the specification with the reference implementation, GraphQL.js, and discussed the implications of proposed changes for future versions of the specification.

## Next Steps

- Mark: Update the schema coordinates implementation in GraphQLJS to handle meta fields appropriately and clarify behavior for schema coordinate resolution
- Lee: Review and merge the schema coordinates PR after Mark's updates
- Lee: Clean up and merge parts 1 and 2 of Benjie's data collections trilogy PRs
- Lee: Review and simplify the data structures notation section at the top of the GraphQL spec before merging related PRs
- Stephen: Update the descriptions on executable definitions PR to deduplicate text between sections 2 and 3, remove redundant definition, and rename section titles
- Lee: Review Benjie's bug fix PR regarding spec text alignment with GraphQLJS implementation
- Lee: Review Benjie's list coercion PR for algorithmic clarity and variable handling
- Martin: Update GraphQLJS to alpha 9 for specified definitions appendix implementation
- Stephen: Continue implementation work on object deprecation RFC and re-engage previous contributors for feedback

## Summary

### Schema and RFC Review Meeting

Lee reviews the agenda for the meeting, which includes discussions on schema coordinates, specified definitions as a new appendix section, descriptions on executable definitions, editorial review for execution result, and several RFCs from Steven and Benjie. Benjie mentions the addition of a new RFC status for GraphQL WG. The meeting begins with introductions from attendees and a reminder to contribute to the notes document, especially for technical content that the AI note-taker might miss.

### Schema Coordinates Proposal Updates

The group discusses updates to the schema coordinates proposal. Mark reports that he has reverted to using dot separators for most elements except arguments, based on majority feedback. Lee recalls the rationale for previously blocking meta fields, but agrees they can be allowed. There is some discussion about edge cases with meta fields, which Mark suggests could be addressed with a clarification in the spec. Lee indicates that the main criteria for approval is having the code available, with the final decision on how to handle meta fields being the last outstanding item. Benjie raises a question about how to represent the schema coordinate for meta fields like __typename. The group considers whether it's realistic to include this in the July release, pending resolution of these final details.

### Meta Fields in Schema Coordinates

The discussion focuses on how to handle meta fields in schema coordinates. Lee explains that meta fields are not part of the schema but are special cases handled during execution. The group agrees that schema coordinates referring to meta fields should be syntactically valid but semantically null when resolved. They decide to add a note in the specification stating that resolving a meta field doesn't return anything. The implementation in GraphQL.js should mirror this behavior. The team also considers the possibility of introducing more specific handling for meta fields in future versions of the specification.

### Type System Definition Reorganization

Martin presents a proposal to group all specified type system definitions in a single appendix at the end of the specification. The group discusses the ordering of fields and directives in the spec, with Lee explaining that the current order is based on dependency, importance, and complexity rather than chronology or alphabetical order. There is some debate about where to place certain fields like "specifiedBy", but the group agrees that consistency between the spec text and GraphQL.js implementation is important.

### GraphQL Pull Request Merge Discussion

Lee suggests merging the pull request with minor changes, including removing modifications to introspection and updating to GraphQL.js alpha 9. Benjie proposes moving some fields to higher positions for better organization. The group agrees to make these changes and merge the pull request. Lee initially misunderstands the proposed changes but quickly corrects himself. The discussion then shifts to descriptions on executable definitions, with Stephen reporting that the spec edits and GraphQL.js implementation are nearly ready. The group considers moving this proposal to RFC 3 status, and Martin mentions that Apollo team members are excited about its potential for AI-related work.

### GraphQL Descriptions Section Restructuring

Stephen and Lee discuss reorganizing the GraphQL specification's sections on descriptions. They agree to move the main definition of descriptions from section 3 to section 2, making it a core language concept rather than just part of the type system. The section in 2 will be titled "Descriptions" and will cover descriptions more holistically, including their use in queries and schemas. Section 3.2 will be renamed "Type System Descriptions," with its content reduced to reemphasize the importance of descriptions in the type system and provide specific examples. They plan to remove duplicate grammar definitions and deduplicate text between the sections.

### GraphQL Schema Deprecation Discussion

Stephen plans to make changes to the GraphQL.js feedback revision and submit it. The group discusses the RFC for deprecation of objects in GraphQL schemas. They agree that everything in a schema should be deprecatable, and that removing deprecated elements should still result in a valid schema. Lee suggests adding an "includeDeprecated" parameter to the __schema field in introspection queries, which would allow clients to view either the full schema or a subset without deprecated elements. The group also discusses the implications of deprecating object types in unions and interfaces, acknowledging the need for a way to maintain these over time.

### RFC Proposals and Data Collections

The group discusses several RFC (Request for Comments) proposals and their progress. They accept and merge a proposal about not excluding the schema keyword if the schema has a description, noting that GraphQL JS already implements this behavior. They also review a set of three related pull requests about data collections, which Benjie wants included in the next spec release to improve accuracy and precision. Lee agrees to include these changes, marking them as accepted, but notes he will make some editorial simplifications before merging. The meeting concludes with a brief mention of additional linked pull requests related to the data collections proposal.

### GraphQL Schema Consistency Improvements

Benjie proposes three changes to improve consistency in GraphQL schema definitions. The first two changes are approved: one clarifies that fields should be returned in a consistent order when possible, and the other recommends maintaining order for unordered elements like enums. The third change, which explicitly marks certain schema parts as ordered, is set aside for further discussion due to potential implications for performance and implementation flexibility. Lee agrees to merge the first two changes.

### GraphQL Specification Bug Review

The group discusses two issues in the GraphQL specification. Benjie presents a longstanding bug in the spec that needs fixing, providing detailed spec text for Lee to review. They also address list coercion, which Benjie has rewritten to use a more algorithmic system and to better handle variables. Lee agrees to carefully review both issues, emphasizing the importance of aligning the spec with the reference implementation, GraphQL.js. The meeting concludes with Lee acknowledging the productivity of the session and the need to finalize the discussed changes.
