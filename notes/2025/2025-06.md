## GraphQL Foundation Marketing Request - Input on AI Topic

- GraphQL Foundation marketing committee would love to hear from you about AI.
- Recognize that we're not hype-oriented, we want to talk about real things
- Target software developer audience building for AI
- Question to TSC: what role do we want to suggest that AI plays in that
  ecosystem
- Please think about these questions
- What would the strategy look like for talking about AI and GraphQL?
- Jeff: curious to get all perspectives, they will all add dimension and weight
  to the piece.
- Are there any concerns?
  - Michael: so long as the content isn't generated no concerns!
- **Questions for TSC: **
  - **Strategic Vision**
    - As AI agents become primary interfaces for digital applications, how do
      you see the fundamental relationship between APIs and applications
      changing over the next 2-3 years? What role should GraphQL play in this
      transformation?
    - Given that AI systems need deterministic, policy-aware API orchestration,
      what specific GraphQL capabilities or patterns do you believe will become
      most critical for agentic applications?
  - **Forward-Looking Predictions**
    - How do you envision the developer experience changing when GraphQL becomes
      the primary abstraction layer between AI and backend systems? What new
      tooling or practices might emerge?
    - With protocols like MCP gaining momentum, how should the GraphQL
      Foundation position GraphQL to capture this wave of AI-driven API
      integration? What strategic initiatives might be most impactful?
    - As other API technologies compete for the AI integration space, what
      unique advantages does GraphQL offer that we should be emphasizing? Where
      is GraphQL most defensible?
  - **Foundation Strategy**
    - Given this AI-driven opportunity, what should be the GraphQL Foundation's
      top 2-3 priorities over the next 18 months to ensure GraphQL becomes the
      standard for AI-API orchestration?
    - What role should the Foundation play in developing standards or best
      practices for GraphQL-based AI integrations? Should we be collaborating
      with AI companies or protocol developers?
    - How can we best mobilize the GraphQL community to build the tooling,
      examples, and advocacy needed for this future?

## GraphQL over HTTP

- How do we make this official (status code) - it’s an IETF spec; we can work
  with them to extend, e.g. to 294
  - Michael expressed some concerns for the impact on gateways
- Do you have concrete examples of this breaking with current running code?
  - Please come to the WG if you want to discuss
- Can we introduce this in a way that is not required? - Agreed that it is a
  “SHOULD” rather than a “MUST”

## Executable descriptions

- We can add descriptions to the schema but not operations. There's already a PR
  open for operation descriptions; I've brought it up to date.

Much more was discussed but no further manual notes were taken; please see the
