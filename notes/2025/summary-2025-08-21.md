Benjie and Mark discussed the implementation status of schema coordinates for the GraphQL spec, with Mark having submitted PRs that Benjie plans to merge into Lee's original pull request before an upcoming conference. They explored standardization needs for persisted queries, particularly focusing on query name uniqueness in mono-repos and potential namespacing approaches to ensure uniqueness across applications. The conversation also covered document identification in GraphQL, debating solutions like aliasing and the implications of having the same document exist in different clients with the same hash.

## Next Steps

- Benjie to review the schema coordinates spec change carefully before GraphQL Kickoff.
- Mark to open a new pull request for the schema coordinates implementation directly to the next branch in GraphQLjs.
- Mark to comment on Lee's pull request about the new implementation with an independent lexer.
- Mark and Benjie to continue the discussion about persisted operations/queries in person at the upcoming conference.

## Summary

### GraphQL Schema Coordinates Implementation Status

Benjie and Mark discuss the status of schema coordinates implementation for the GraphQL spec. Mark has submitted PRs for both the spec change and a JavaScript implementation with an independent lexer, but they haven't been reviewed yet. The implementation avoids including unnecessary elements like whitespace and comments while maintaining position tracking for error messages. Benjie decides to merge Mark's changes into Lee's original pull request and will review the spec changes before the upcoming GraphQL conference.

### Persisted Query Standardization Discussion

Mark discusses the need for standardization around persisted queries, particularly focusing on the issue of query name uniqueness in mono-repos where different projects might have identical query names but different operations. He proposes a namespacing approach for query names to ensure uniqueness across applications, which would help with setting appropriate constraints and alerts. Benjie suggests discussing this topic further in person and mentions an alternative approach of generating one trusted document containing all fragments and operations for each client version, using the operation name as a reference within that document.

### GraphQL Document Identification Solutions

Benjie and Mark discuss document identification in GraphQL, with Benjie suggesting aliasing as a solution. Mark explains that people want to write config files with aliases that correlate to SHA hashes, allowing them to update queries without changing config files. They debate the implications of having the same document exist in different clients with the same hash, creating a many-to-one mapping issue. Benjie suggests storing both the hash and metadata about where documents come from, while Mark expresses concern about the complexity of requiring repository names and other metadata to compute document hashes.
