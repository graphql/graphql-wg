The GraphQL Working Group meeting covered several key topics, including editorial changes to error propagation, fragment memoization, and service capabilities syntax. Discussions focused on improving schema coordinates, refining error handling mechanisms, and implementing a new system for representing service capabilities. The team debated various approaches to these issues, considering factors such as implementation complexity, backward compatibility, and potential future extensions.

## Next Steps

- Lee: Draft spec changes for schema coordinates to define it as its own grammar with its own set of tokens
- Mark: Implement schema coordinates changes in GraphQL.js with a separate lexer implementation
- Benjie: Write up a proposal for service capabilities syntax with dot-separated names and share with the composite schemas working group
- Lee: Review Benjie's service capabilities proposal once drafted
- Benjie: Discuss with Yaakov about implementing schema coordinates as a map of String to Boolean for deferred status
- Benjie: Break out the editorial changes for response position definition in the spec as a separate pull request

## Summary

### GraphQL Working Group Agenda Review

The GraphQL Working Group meeting began with a round of introductions and a technical check of microphones and audio. Lee Byron announced the agenda, which included editorial changes on error propagation, removing fragment spread names from visited fragments, service capabilities syntax, and schema coordinates. The group agreed to prioritize schema coordinates due to their tight scope. Mark and Martin were set to lead discussions on their respective topics, but the transcript ended before they could begin.

### GraphQL Schema Coordinate Grammar Changes

The team discussed removing whitespace from schema coordinates to ensure uniqueness, with Mark proposing changes to GraphQL.js and the spec. Leebyron suggested creating a separate grammar for schema coordinates, which would simplify implementation and reduce the risk of conflicts with other GraphQL features. The group agreed this approach would be cleaner and more maintainable, though it might delay the schema coordinate feature's inclusion in the spec cut release. Mark, who is currently on vacation, will review the proposed changes when he returns.

### GraphQL Error Propagation Changes

Benjie discussed an issue with error propagation in GraphQL where errors could be added to the errors array after the response was sent, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. He proposed a change to the spec to prevent further errors from being added once an error has propagated, ensuring that only the error from the non-nullable field that caused the null value is thrown. Leebyron raised concerns about the complexity of enforcing this rule in parallel processing scenarios and suggested alternative approaches like including both the origin and settlement positions of errors. They also discussed the original motivation for error propagation, which was to address product engineering needs for safe data access, and considered how to better support these use cases in GraphQL.

### Response Position Naming Debate

Benjie proposed renaming "response position" to "execution position" to better describe a position that can be reached during execution, even if it doesn't exist in the final response due to error propagation. Leebyron expressed concerns about the change, arguing that the term "response position" more accurately reflects the intent of the position in terms of response keys and paths. They agreed that an editorial clarification of the definition is necessary, emphasizing that the position might not be in the final response due to error propagation. Benjie decided to revert the name change and focus on refining the definition further.

### GraphQL Error Propagation Discussion

The team discussed implementing a new error propagation behavior in GraphQL, where errors would be thrown instead of propagated. Leebyron expressed concerns about removing information and the potential impact on telemetry, while Martin questioned if it was too late to implement this change. Benjie explained that while 100% adoption of no-error propagation might not be achievable, the throw-on-error pattern is already useful and being used in practice. The team debated whether the benefits of accurate error handling justified the complexity of implementation, ultimately concluding that while it might not be crucial for most cases, it could provide value for developers who need to handle errors more precisely.

### GraphQL Fragment Memoization Strategy

Benjie and Leebyron discussed the handling of fragment memoization in GraphQL, focusing on the challenges of tracking visited fragments and the implications of removing this mechanism. They agreed on using a map to store fragment signatures with their respective colors (deferred or not) to handle potential conflicts and improve performance. Benjie planned to consult Yaakov about implementing this approach and ensuring compatibility with GraphQL.js. They also briefly touched on the topic of service capabilities, which Benjie mentioned would be discussed further in the composite schemas working group.

### GraphQL Service Capabilities Syntax Discussion

Benjie proposed a new syntax for service capabilities in GraphQL, suggesting a dot-separated string format (name.name.name) with optional trailing values. Leebyron expressed concern about overcomplicating the syntax and proposed a simpler alternative using just strings, while both agreed that the syntax should be unambiguous and easily represented in URLs. They discussed the possibility of future extensions, including quoted identifiers, and concluded that starting with a constrained format would be preferable to allowing any arbitrary input.

### GraphQL Capabilities URL System

The group discussed adding capabilities to GraphQL, with Benjie proposing a system where capabilities could be represented as URL strings that point to documentation, allowing for lightweight checks of feature existence. Leebyron supported the idea of using well-known URLs for documentation, and Benjie outlined several use cases including websocket URLs, error propagation behaviors, and trusted document methods. The team agreed to include a non-normative note in the specification about string formatting, and Benjie committed to writing up a proposal for review by the composite schemas working group.
