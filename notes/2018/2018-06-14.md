# GraphQL WG Meeting #6

## Update on Spec Release (LB 5m)
* cut earlier this week
* final version of the spec
* updated index page for site with list of versions
* subscriptions, SDL, validation fixes
* Lee wants to cut ref impl really soon
* next major version should be spec compliant
* thanks to Ivan for doing a lot of work
* GH milestones + tasks -> 2 tasks left
* Release cut tomorrow at GraphQL-Europe

## Should Interfaces be required to be implemented? (#460) (LB 10m)
* schema validation rules came with SDL
* before only verbal rules
* this rule "at least one object must implement each interface", was added after the fact
* incorporated into graphql-js
* pulling it in, caused things to break
* Michael: might break schema stitching
* value vs. cost -> revert that rule change + discussion
* RFC for that change now
* original scenario: return field with interface that is not implemented (only null valid)
   * non-nullable would be invalid schema
* similar validation rule for fragments
* remote interfaces by stitched schema
* "how does stitching actually work"
* validate before or only after ?
* "you can stitch full schemas or individual types or valid schemas" - it's a bit open
* do these rules exist for other things like enums/unions too?
   * no usage rules
   * probably have a separate discussion on that topic?
* Oleg: Sangria has also additional types
   * that caused issues
   * so now you can configure it if they are exposed
   * by default not
* cleaner docs with the validation rule?
* Michael: graphqlint vs. hard rule?
   * code quality checks instead?
   * optional validation tool in graphql-tools for these additional rules
* MH: Warning vs. Error
* LB lint should have some opinion
   * validation rule is stronger 
   * currently validation rules also contain "lint" like things
   * doesn't like warnings
* IG: strong validation rules -> put pressure on tools
   * GraphQL-JS:
      *  validation after construction (separate at first execution)
      * at execution time: valid query and also valid schema
* James B: you can't see interfaces through introspection?
* Matt: SDL is different than raw introspection queries ???
* JS: Helper libraries for common types (URL, Email, … )
   * also separate validation rules in those helpers
   * those libs should also use the regular schema validation rules
* Michael: 
   * executable schema
   * bag of connected types/common types -> different validation rules?
   * introspection schema is also bag of types
   * distinction on use-cases ?
* LB tools don't differentiate between use-cases
* Oleg: syntax rules vs. validation rules
   * also with schema extension of types etc. with directives
   * move one field syntax rule to validation
   * semantic vs. syntactic 
* LB: we made the syntax rule to allow zero fields
   * have a document that parses but is invalid
   * we should always start with the most strict grammar and later loosen the grammar
   * Action Items
* reasonable discussion continue
* other unconnected pieces of the schema (e.g. enums)
* stitching ?

## Update on: limiting the scope of "Directives Are Unique Per Location" validation, #429. (OI 10m)
* Oleg: relaxing validation rules for directives 
   * at the moment we only allow one directive with the same name on the same place/field
   * you can work around it a bit with fragments
   * asked original author of the validation if it is ok to change or remove this rule
   * shouldn't be a problem at FB (used a hashmap for directive-names)
   * motivation: type/schema extension "add partial schemas several times"
   * compose resolution logic
* LB: no order of directives in spec, its up to the author
* Oleg: no order for input fields
* LB: many tools use directives as/in hashmaps
   * make sure to to disallow ambiguous queries
   * suggestion: rewrite the rules to apply only to directives in the spec
   * otherwise you have to write your own validation rules
* MH: in our use-cases multiple directives would actually be harmful
   * languages have annotations and also stuck with single instances and added arrays of input-objects inside instead
* JS: encountered both scenarios - uniqueness / vs. multiple uses (for better DSL)
* JS: perhaps separate @skip/@include from spec and ship as separate tool
* IG: how do you support popular tools and their directives and validation rules
* MH: Meta directives?
* LB: suggestion add sth to the grammar for the directive definition like "allow multiples"


### Action Item:
* Oleg to write the spect test
* clear language that we don't regress on skip/include
* see thread comments from Jan
* Grammar extensions
* Multiple RFC (remove rule, additional syntax rule, meta directives) + IG with use-cases




## Discuss proposed RFC for inputUnion type. Related graphql-js PR. (TG 10m)
* TG: slides - lack of input unions
* Lack of input unions leads to either runtime server validation or many similar Mutation fields each with varying input signatures.
* clients doesn't know if input signature is valid
* Main blocker: Difficulty disambiguating between input unions
* Current. Tagged Unions 
   * is not type-checked b/c fields are optional not required no check that you provide each field exactly once
* Proposed: new type inputUnion  with __inputname in payload  similar to __typename in union type
* backwards compatible, opt-in
* __inputName could be valid for any payload
* original motivation: lack of overloading 
* LB doesn't like __inputName
   * currently all inputs can be represented as raw data
   * are there other solutions that were tried?
   * not really?
   * current proposal is similar to unions
   * one usecase: scalar or object types (e.g. generic filtering inputs) -> we should support that
* JS: would map great to TypeScript declarations
* Steve: also the generic/scalar usecases
   * how would it work with nested inputs?
* TG you would have to pass it for any of the input types, some way to specify each input
* LB: suggestion treat it similar to TS unions, try types in order
* TG likes that
* Oleg: has the same issue with abstract types, he sees this as error prone to use order
* LB: do it as part of schema validation, check for potential abiguity
* Oleg: semantically different types even if they have the same data
* LB: Flow -> any type can supply an actual string , additional discriminator
* LB does it really matter if there is ambiguity ? he doesn't see it as problem
* Ivan: tagged union
* JS: really likes the discriminating


### Action item:
* TG to iterate over the use-cases with concrete data to decide on ambiuguity




## Future work process, direction, representatives from Facebook? (MH 5m)
* LB wills stay spec editor
   * will continued to contribute to graphql-js
   * Ivan contributes a lot 
* Matt: FB was iterating a lot internally on things that the oss community doesn't need, or would be incompatible
   * still want to build on top of current spec
   * he will continue to pull in latest spec releases
   * fix breaking changes internally vs. handling 
* LB Jan Joerges should join these WG sessions
   * he designed FB servers
   * Matt point person for client + tooling 
   * Jan for server related things
* JS: lot of the industry is shaping around this
   * need some security
   * originally a lot of FB people were involved
   * now more outside community
   * future? foundation / independent group ?
   * how will FB be able to contribute / run in the future ?
* LB: not all people want consistent contributions of FB
   * want to see different kinds of contributions
   * FB open sourcing GraphQL -> setting a ship out to sail
   * now GraphQL has been open as long as not before
   * also a reason to start the working groups
   * no surprise that there is now more contribution from the outside
* JS: many decisions have been owned / blocked by FB
   * had to chase many people on FB to get things in
* LB: future changes should be tactical
   * foundation vs. no foundation -> slow moving process, little value
   * WG is social commitment, is a "foundation", 
   * other foundations involved legal commitments, money, …
   * like JS -> third party ECMA
* JS: if there is movement it should not be blocked by FB
* LB: we should actively talk about that problem and solve it
   * OSS team, bring people in, allow permissions on repos (commit, PR)
* Matt: for example graphql-js Ivan is a trusted committer/contributor
   * we can pull them in fairly quickly
* LB: some projects are not as active as graphql-js (graphiql, language service, …)
* Nick: is there a model that we want to emulate?
* JS: not enough thinking on it
   * FB owns a lot of these things, wants to fix the blocking
   * open to conversation about model + contributions
* LB: add active contributors


### Action Items.
* Johannes to identify stalled projects
* then we can add active contributors


## Partial Results (Defer, Batch, Stream) Lee's Presentation 2016 (MH 5-10m)
* LB: Daniel W. and LB built Defer into client Relay for FB's internal Batch API as a compile target 
   * not very compelling, very challenging
   * challenge was integrating it into the client frameworks, lots of effort
   * pursuing it from the angle of the relay team was not enough
   * look for example that show spromising 
   * will not come from FB / the relay project
* JS: we're now 2 years in the future
   * community thinks FB is working on this
   * please share the findings
* LB will ask Daniel
* Matt: my team is continuing to experiment with these directives
   * has still not figured out a compelling answer
   * doesn't expect answer out of FB
   * perhaps a specific answer for the concrete infrastructure, but don't hold your breath
   * findings would have implementation details that are very specific
* LB: Jan + Adam at the GraphQL server are really interested in this
* LB: a public post would be great on this
* MH: large data volumes 
* LB: the boundaries have to be decided by the client, b/c each flush causes a rende
* Oleg: Brad implemented at Atlassian Deferred and Stream we would love to hear
* Ivan: This also includes normalization
* LB: server side normalization is still interesting
   * you have to add additional validation rules for determining duplicates
* JS: aliased objects make it harder to decide if two paths are the same or not
* Ivan: Falcor -> look there
* Ivan: _id field for a globally unique ID -> also affects normalization


## Licensing issues: express-graphql, codemirror-graphql, GraphiQL, Logo. (IG 5m)

* IG: connected to FB + OSS discussion
   * current patents can be switched to MIT but need FB legal department
* LB: from what I learned from the move to MIT -> move on a case by case basis
   * Matt could help to flag these 3 projects to the OSS team/legal team
* Matt doesn't expects changes any time soon
* LB: logo license -> should be CC license 
   * code license on spec was wrong -> content license
* IG biggest problem is point of contact in this issue, the WG is kinda the point of contact
   * it would be beneficial to have a clearer message around FB + OSS / licenses
* LB Joel from the OSS team has been tremendously helpful


### Action Item:
* LB to bring logo license to attention
* Matt to flag the three projects to OSS/Legal at FB
* JS/IG: set up a plan with concrete topics, open an issue for Joel to take on for internal advocacy
* Send Joel Marcy a big present



## Streaming (JS)

* JS: a list of things that are currently not possible
   * for a next version of GraphQL
   * currently GraphQL is tied to (mobile) application
   * a lot is happening in the infrastructure (grpc, nbor, …) which
* LB: graphql are not bound to JSON or a transport
   * there are streaming serialization techniques
   * there could be a server that (CaptnProto) requires streamed upside-down
   * for services to service communication
* JS: lots of infrastructure tools support GRPC and different serializers (thrift, protobuf etc)
   * there could be misconceptions that mistreats GraphQL
* LB: if you could go back and what you would change is an interesting consideration (good keynote)
   * none of them tackled transport
   * GraphQLs solve API boundaries for clients
   * hope that at some point there will be something better than graphql
   * take ideas from graphql but apply them to new domains
   * best of both worlds
* JS: how would it look like if yo could break it up into
   * typesystem, resolvers, ….
* LB: the spec should be a trailing indicator
   * people should be able to build stuff
   * Neo4j started with some graphql like features internally but then used graphql as an optional API
   * Rapid API Inno -> tries to solve api space / weird fork
   * Tooling is important and breaks if you move outside the spec
* LB Neo is using directives and graphcool too
* JS: composing schema, importing namespaces, are parts of thrift etc.
   * but we are observing and 
   * Schema gets composed into one place / file and then it's locked
* LB if we had specced things like that back then it would have been wrong, as we didn't have the experience in those areas at FB
* Oleg: there different ways
   * we need a language independent way
   * directives are big thing
* JS: what would be good for the community is to see the boundaries
   * initially graphql + relay were perceived as the same thing
   * that there is schema vs. validation vs. query execution 
   * distinct concepts
* Matt: withing FB we now started to figured out the depth graph of GraphQL
   * we tried to use a lot of the proposals (like graphql-config etc)
   * none of those worked in our case
   * would recommend against formalizing too much on the execution
* Oleg: offer alternatives and discussions 
   * show leadership


## Oleg: when a lot of people are not in the same room it is hard to indicate that you want to contribute

* Ivan: Node.js has a system to solve that as well

### Action Item: JS: Zoom: has a "raise my hand"
