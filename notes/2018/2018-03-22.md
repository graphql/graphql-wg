# GraphQL WG Meeting #4 Notes (March 22, 2018)

[Agenda](../agendas/2018-03-22.md)


## Update on next GraphQL Spec Release
- In last meeting, SDL was the last blocker for next version of the spec
- Identified compelling blocker: default values and null

## Question about cadence, timeframe between releases  
  - This release is special, a lot of new releases
  - Interconnected parts to this release
  - Tradeoff between scrutiny on individual proposals – where changes affect the dynamics between parts – to ensure integration quality
  - Prioritize the core stability of GraphQL, assure the community
  - Changing the behavior of existing use cases in GraphQL should proceed with caution especially considering query execution and potential security issues.

### Is semver the right fit?

  - Gold standard is no breaking changes
  - Inspiration from TC39 to reference year and/or month – annual cadence
  - Most of the work for cutting involves documenting changes and spec changes

### Boundaries for different aspects: execution, validation, SDL, etc
  - Issues of compatibility: whole or unit based
  - Supporting one functionality but not the rest does not exclude a framework or library from being labeled as true "GraphQL"

### How to track and identify pull requests for next cut/release?

- Identifying stage of proposal lifecycle
- Preference for high scrutiny on what makes next release, limited to security issues and high impact changes

### Including next-generation proposals
    - Browser includes stage-2 and stage-3 proposals in release before they complete. GraphQL should be no different
    - Let maintainers decide whether to put proposals behind a flag.

## Proposal: Interface Extends - Mike Marcacci
  - Interface implements another interface

### Example Use Case: Relay Cursor Specification

- Interfaces to drive a connection wouldn't work if you wanted a connection that returns a particular interface
- More than one layer of wrapping allows no way to declare an interface and subset of interface selection

### Implementation

- Allow an interface to declare that it implements another interface
  - All concrete types must declare an interface of what they implement
  - Change in metadata only
  - RFC is prepared, implemented in GraphQL JS
    - Not much to change in Relay
  - Insights in to change costs?
    - In Sangria, when defining object types or interfaces you can implement other interfaces. Not exposed to introspection

### Raise Concern: Change Cost
- Clarify what use cases are exposed – brand new that couldn't be expressed before, or making existing use cases less awkward
- Need to identify other use cases and edge cases
- Interface validation is already in another PR
- From client perspective, consuming JSON output and introspection query requires spec change
- Change costs for code generation and type generation based on schema

#### Raised Concern: Error Handling
  - Object implementing NamedNode, but not Node will fail validation on compliation per RFC
  - Fields are required to be defined as own fields if extending another interface

## Null default values
  - Issue occurs in both GraphQL JS and confirmed by Oleg
  - Before null became a literal value in language, absence and null were same thing
    - Type that is nullable that had a default value, result of that variable could be safely passed to an argument that requires non-null version
      - Ex: Query loads by ID, default ID is nullable default object
      - Passing it through to something that needs ID is non-issue until null literal was introduced
        - Default value could be null and passed to non-null
      - Potential attack vector for sending null to non-nullable
      - Any value, even passed with null literal, is possible to pass to non-nullable
    - Non-nullable needs guarantee to not have null at runtime

### Proposal - Lee Byron

  - If default value is null literal, validator should catch passing to non-nullable
  - Passing a runtime null value – change resolution of actual runtime value (null) to use the default value instead
  - No argument passed vs null
  - Changes execution behavior

### Counter-Proposal - Lee Byron

  - Don't change execution behavior
  - Change validation rules – if variable has default value, throw error if it's a non-nullable type. Have to declare it as also non-nullable
    - Can still add default value, cannot be null
    - Can't pass runtime null
  - All existing queries would be invalid, shipped clients with runtime assembly and live validation will break.

### Discussion
  - Observation: least used features is default values
  - Goal should be a clear mental model
  - If using counterproposal, some awkward compatibility mode
    - Rather than checking for null, add an additional null check
  - Prefer high stability, both are potentially breaking, which breakage is more costly?
  - More knowledge around impact of queries vs fields
  - Need to make suggestions for three audiences:
    - Maintainers - easy
    - Administrators – manageable
    - Query writers – high impact
  - Using a feature flag
    - Disable particular validations if they want to stay compatible
    - Another RFC: if union inputs were allowed nullable or non-nullable. Any nulls would use current behavior. Anything non-nullable would use the next behavior.
  - Actionable items:
    - Sizing impact

## OpenCrud - Johannes Schickling
  - Goal is that community can specify how you would expose a MySQL database or Cassandra database through a GraphQL API
    - Relational databases
    - Graph databases
    - Document databases
    - Time series databases
  - How to create a spec to expose large data?
  - Per category of databases, with explicit purpose for each category


***

## Top Level Directives - Johannes Schickling  
  - Node package GraphQL imports, why are we commenting it out?
    - Using directives instead, but more cumbersome to use
    - Few proposals for addressing syntactical fatigue
  - Following up – help wanted
    - High impact on schema stitching
    - Already have top level directive in some sense with directive on schema itself
    - Concatenating files together comes with pitfalls, hierarchy issues


***

## GraphQL JS Documentation

  - Currently is a series of markdown files in the org site
  - Preference to be language agnostic, platform aware
  - Documentation rot as GraphQL JS has evolved
    - Contrast to high visibility of documentation in the code itself
    - High value, open to ecosystem
  - High impact in pointing from language-specific documentation to the org/platform documentation.
  - Suggestion: have a section for all languages and resources

### Reflection from Siddharth Gupta

  - Concepts can be overwhelming, sometimes requiring different degrees of experience
  - Having access to end-to-end examples is important

### Actionable items

  - Shifting responsibility of maintainers to link to better resources
  - Separation of GraphQL JS from Platform websites
  - Stability for linking to stable and draft specs, resources


***

## Achieving Parity in Ecosystem

  - Misunderstanding that node/JS is the only way to run in production
  - Possible influence of tight coupling of JS/Platform documentation
  - Expect same behaviors between languages
  - Maintainer cadence – creating a chat to bring maintainers together
  - Central repository for each spec feature
  - Maintainers must be able to test against acceptance tests
  
### GraphQL CATS

  - Application to multiple languages using drivers
  - Idea: requiring tests to add to spec, etc
  - Write schema and query, but what about resolvers?
    - Directives in Java
    - Leveraging the strength of languages resulting in different APIs
    - JavaScript and other functional languages have primitive resolvers
    - Counterexample: Java annotations
  - Need to add more drivers
