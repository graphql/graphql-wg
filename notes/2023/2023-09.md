### Explicit BlockString definition

- Benjie: GraphQL
  [spec change](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1042). We use
  BlockString in our grammar but not have it defined anywhere else. So this
  change adds the definition
- General 👍

### Full Schemas

- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R8b4duEIi8iigAH4AU2zNNGlEC6f9CZYC9sVTgLjFHI/edit#slide=id.g27972193ce9_0_97)
- Martin: a follow up on the last wg meeting
  - Apollo Kotlin
  - Apollo has started to encourage people to use SDL for tooling
  - When they have custom scalars, the tooling breaks because the spec forbids
    scalars from being transmitted in SDL
  - Full schema = Regular schema + Built-in definitions
  - Built-in definitions are
    - Builtin Scalars (Int, Float, etc.)
    - Directives
  - 3 questions
    - Do we want to introduce 2 concepts in the spec?
      - Martin: personally feels that this is too much. It’s more flexible for
        the implementation to introduce its own definitions
      - Kewei: How do we know how many bits “Int” scalar uses if we omit the
        definition?
        - Martin:
    - Is therea rule that all SDL definitions must be used?
      - Matt: What does it meant to be “used”?
        - Martin:
    - How far should there be 1:1 equivalence between introspection & SDL
- Martin: PR is up to update the spec to define built-in definitions
- Matt: Really likes the appendix. Relay has these defined but would like to use
  something from the schema
- Benjie: same for the directives too
- Martin: will remove the “must” language on the scalars from the spec
- Matt: when you are handwriting a schema, you don’t want to handwrite these
  built-in definitions
- Matt: It would be messy to get these definitions in the spec. There is a
  difference between the schema the tooling should consume and the handwritten
  schema. Should the schema always be compliant to the spec?
- Martin: a newcomer will not know what these scalars are without them in the
  spec
- Matt:
- Martin: why did the spec forbid including these definitions?
- Benjie: removing the definitions prevents custom definitions from conflicting
  with the spec’s definitions
- Martin: why can we not provide the flexibility and fail early if the server
  doesn’t support?
- Benjie: that introduces a lot of edge cases
- — some gap
- Matt: we may require a different type of SDL. the current spec specifies the
  resolver type schema

### Relay Error Handling

- _[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rfWeBcyJkiNqyxPxUIKxgbExmfdjA70t)_
- Itamar:
  - Why?
    - Graphql responses with errors are just discarded and it’s not possible to
      distinguish null from nulls due to errors.
  - Relay error handling
    - Default behavior: field errors throw
      - Replaces null on field-level server error.
      - Opting into the old behavior with ‘@catch’ directive
      - @catch directive returns the error at the field level. With an optional
        parameter for the old-behavior
      - @catch does not change the graphql response, only Relay response
  - Interop
    - If @required throws, @catch will catch the exception
    - CCN
      - @required and ! will behave the same
      - ? will null bubble, @catch will not.
  - Progress
    - [Post in Relay repo outlining the project](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/4416)
    - [Post about larger “True Schema Nullability”](https://github.com/graphql/client-controlled-nullability-wg/issues/19)
      in Client Controlled Nullability
- Kewei: what will the types of the fields be? Is it a union?
  - Matt: discriminated union or &lt;some other option>
- Alex: Will @catch be defined in the spec?
  - Jordan: This will not be. Relay client will handle this. Relay will parse
    the directive out before the request goes to the server
- Anthony: Does this unblock the concerns around CCN’s ‘!’ and ‘?’?
  - Jordan: It is aligned with CCN. Not sure if the server needs to change yet.
    Would like to see other smart clients adopt this first and then see if the
    server needs to change.
  - Matt: CCN provides a way for the server to express its true nullability and
    the smart clients can override it with CCN designators.
- Martin: Can you share the slides?
  - Itamar: will do
- Martin: how does it impact fragments merging?
  - Jordan: Because the behavior is all in the client side, different fragments
    will see different behaviors unlike CCN impacting fragments across.
- Ernie: will the errors be surfaced in the field?
  - Matt: the same metadata on errors will be made available in the fields
  - Jordan: certain errors will be made opaque from the product engineers
- Robert: what happens when multiple errors happen inside the selection set?
  - Itamar: if a parent sees multiple exceptions, all errors will be provided
    with their paths
  - Robert: does Relay want to support the schemas where a field’s type is a
    union type (result type + error type)
    - Matt: That is about generics in GraphQL which is a larger conversation
    - Itamar: For this proposal, uniform error type would be the goal
- Robert: what should be the schema if other clients want to support the same
  behavior?
  - Itamar: This is a client side feature, so don’t plan on proposing schema
    changes.

### Changing ExecuteSelectionSet to ExecuteGroupedFieldSet

- Benjie:
  - When working on the incremental delivery, found the refactoring on the spec
    desirable
  - Please review https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1039

### Client Controlled Nullability updates

- Young: stripping down the proposal to have just the “!”. Semantics of “?” is
  very unclear and leads to ambiguity. The “!” semantic will just change the
  field nullability from null to nonnull.
  - Would like to go to stage 3, and seek feedback on whether there is concern
    with stripping the “?”.
  - Curious what Relay and others think of not having the “?”
- Jordan: interested in “?” in the long term. Gives us flexibility in the long
  term, without the client developers needing to assert nonnull blindly. If the
  client can shield users from dealing with nulls from errors. Would be okay if
  this needs to be done as a second phase.
- Matt: The outcome from the error handling workshop, the end state of client
  side error handling should mirror exactly the server behavior.
  - Total ideal for error handling to have the “!” that will transform the error
    to error.
  - Give us a migration path to truly understand the server nullability.
- Jordan: any client using a consistency store is damaged by null bubbling. So
  “?” would gives us the ability to opt out of the null bubbling.
- Anthony: remove “?” from CCN seems to be resolved by the @catch directive? Do
  we still want to pursue the “!” -only proposal. Or do we want to continue with
  both operators?
- Young: relay’s concern is mostly resolved. But still concerned about potential
  6-month delay about re-opening conversations about discussing 2-3 options.
- Alex: “!” is popular and easy to justify and easy to merge. Then we can figure
  out the stuff that’s less popular
- Matt: “?” might need a different champion.
- Martin: The community has limited attention span as well.
- Jordan: “!” as a primitive makes sense. The community moves slowly so we need
  “!” in the meantime. Not oppose to it existing as a concept.
- Ernie: People wouldn’t be able to control one without the other. So if we only
  introduce “!” we might limit the adoption because people cannot control it
  without “?”. Also a risk for having a new person champion the “?”, whether
  it’s going to be done. You need to have both in conjunction. Can’t have one
  without the other.
- Benjie: in favor of simple “!”. But, when you have this null bubbling, you
  can’t do caching anymore because it’s not safe. We should spend some time
  thinking about how to not break normalized caches.
- Robert: if you want to play with it, you can add a magical field “\_\_self”
  that refers to itself. We just need to be clear on the messaging that “?” is
  coming later.
- Young: for a federated server to react to “?” correctly, it needs to resolve
  its dependency. It needs more time to figure it out.
- Jordan: additional damage done by the “!”, Relay’s perspective is to implement
  it entirely on the client side, treat it similar to @required with fragment
  isolation.
- Martin: if the user start copy pasting to GraphiQL, then they won’t get the
  same result. But @require is a directive, but “!” is on the language.
- Jordan: It’s not practical to copy pasting with Relay already. We need to
  actually figure out the real query.
