## Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Lee)

- Benjie
- Hugh

## Review agenda (2m, Lee)

- [no comments]

## Review prior secondary meetings (5m, Lee)

- [WG secondary APAC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/01-Jan/11-wg-secondary-apac.md)
- [WG secondary EU](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/01-Jan/19-wg-secondary-eu.md)
- Main advancement: Scalars website is now live.
- Secondary advancements: the increased cadence has helped increase the velocity
  of stream/defer and fragment arguments discussions.
- Review of fragment arguments would be useful now, so please have a read!

## Review previous meeting's action items (5m, Lee)

- [Ready for review](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Ready+for+review+%F0%9F%99%8C%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

- [Skipped]

## TSC: Election Results (5m, TSC)

- Successful election with 10 nominees and only 1 person who put themselves up
  for reelection.
- Congrats to the new TSC members, and to Andi on re-election!
- Thanks to everyone who nominated themselves.
- Best thing about TSC is we mostly defer to the WG, so everyone can take a
  leadership role.

## TSC: Management of build and publish infrastructure, secrets, etc (20m, Benjie / Rikki)

- This meeting is being recorded, so be mindful of the audience - we can take
  some of these communications private if need be
- GraphiQL's last publish was partially unsuccessful due to token issues:
  [graphql/graphiql#2997](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/2997)
- GraphQL Foundation should have a more robust process for handling planned or
  emergency token revokation for individuals
- [Rikki has proposed a solution](https://gist.github.com/benjie/739e119b68422a14864486a9ff0b2a8c)
- Thomas is stepping in for Rikki
- Matt: Ideally two or three owners. TSC members? Require 3 of these users to do
  a minor version bump and release (even a NOOP), just to test. If we don't
  exercise it, there's no guarantee it will work.
- Benjie: this partly relates to the auto-deployment from CI, which has security
  implications around tokens and two-factor authentication tokens.
- Lee: GitHub Actions auto-deploy is the best balance between security and
  convenience. Local project maintainers just need to do the mechanics of a
  version bump, they don't have to worry about tokens/MFA/etc.
- Benjie: what's the next steps? GraphiQL is currently broken.
- Lee: there's the right way, which I'll take ownership of. Is there something
  we can do today to unstick GraphiQL?
- Thomas: short term would be to have a token with all the necessary
  permissions, even a personal token.
- Benjie: I believe the issue is that even TSC members don't have access to the
  `@graphiql/*` package
- **ACTION**: @leeb - address this.

## Fix ambiguity around when schema definition may be omitted (10m, Benjie)

- [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/987); previously discussed
  in September
- Aim: merge this (mostly) editorial change
- Lee: this is a change in behavior but it does seem to align with the intent.
- Lee: lets check this with the implementations to make sure there's no issues
  there. It may be that when printing the schema out there is an issue where the
  old behavior was followed.
- Benjie: I think the code block in the top comment can be used as a test case -
  read the code in, generate the schema from it, and print it out - it should be
  the same (i.e. no `mutation` operation)
- **ACTION** - Benjie - tag implementors and check that this won't cause issues.

## Advance argument name uniqueness to Stage 3 (10m, Benjie)

- [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/891)
- [GraphQL.js implementation is merged](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3208)
- Issue still remains; generally agreed this needs to be addressed
- Champion hasn’t been at the WG’s, so what are our next steps here; what is the
  process for moving this forward
- Someone should claim champion (Ivan did on the code side; PR was merged a
  while back)
- Spec needs to be updated to agree with the reference implementation now
- Looks straightforward - folks agree it’s ready to advance
- It’s ready to merge … merged, YAY!

## @defer: fully deduplicate response (30m, Ivan)

- [RFC]([robrichard/defer-stream-wg#65 (comment)](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/65#discussioncomment-4757697))
- GraphQL.js implementation: TBD
- Agreed at the previous working group that deferred fields that also exist in
  the parent (non-deferred) selection set should be omitted since they're
  already satisfied.
- Then we agreed that sibling `@defer`s should also merge, so
  `... @defer { a b } … @defer { a c }` should become `... @defer { a b c }`
- Rob has come up with some challenging examples to see what would happen.
- For some examples we can solve them statically and they don't cause any
  issues.
  - A defer directly inside a defer (`... @defer { … @defer { ??? } }`) is a bit
    controversial, and it's hard to extract the intent that the user had when
    writing the query
  - The incremental delivery WG generally agree that all the defers at the same
    "path" (independent of selection sets) should be merged together, so
    `... @defer {a {b} … @defer {a { c } } }` should be equivalent to
    `...@defer { a { b c } }`.
- For more complex examples, we cannot determine statically how to fully
  deduplicate because e.g. two defers can come in either order. One option is to
  deduplicate at runtime and handle it at the transport layer.
- Matt: we shouldn't have incremental payloads that don't satisfy at least one
  @defer - i.e. a defer should not be split over multiple payloads.
  - Matt [chat]: I feel weakly that there should be _at most_ one incremental
    payload at the same path, and if there’s response duplication or _fewer_
    payloads than defers, that’s preferred.
  - Matt [chat]: I think product developers are expecting _at least_ a complete
    set of data for the path they’re asking for and can’t actually _use_ an
    incremental payload that isn’t yet completed, at which point there’s no use
    to splitting the payloads beyond once per path
- Ivan's slides:
  [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hlq7sLCyxm4DQbi-7rciRFRZePmdrbgXD4dB5NL_DaM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hlq7sLCyxm4DQbi-7rciRFRZePmdrbgXD4dB5NL_DaM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Default Value Validation Status Check (5m, Yaacov)

- [Lee's original implementation PR stack at graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3049)
- [Now rebased on main](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3814)
- [Benjie's Spec PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/793)
- Yaacov: call to action: review the implementation PR and how it aligns with
  the spec PR.
- **ACTION** - everyone: review these PRs!
- Matt was asking about what would happen if a scalar input value could be
  serialized to undefined. Does this lead to surprising behavior? Okay to just
  throw an error? Hopefully not a breaking change.
- Ivan: not a breaking change to the spec. If necessary we can make a breaking
  change to GraphQL.js in a major version. I'd release this as a major release
  of GraphQL.js anyway. GraphQL.js aims to be replicable in other languages
  (e.g. GraphQL python is a direct copy) and most languages don't have a
  difference between null and undefined.
- Benjie: every other language that implemented the old behavior should also
  release this under a major version bump because it concretely changes behavior
  of edge cases.
- Lee: we should be clear about this because the difference is subtle.
- **ACTION** - Matt / Yaacov - tag Lee at the relevant line of code to review.
