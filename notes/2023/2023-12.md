# Primary

Agenda:
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/12-Dec/07-wg-primary.md

## Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Benjie)

- Alex Reilly

## Review agenda (2m, Benjie)

- Done

## Updates from the group formerly known as the Client Controlled Nullability WG (5m, Alex)

- CCN is on hold, replaced by True Nullability
- CCN WG is now “Nullability WG”
- Alex: should we remove the feature from GraphQL-js?
- Ivan: provide in PR a strong reason why flag is being removed, then remove it.
  It’s good to clean up failed experiments. We should probably clean up some
  others too.

## Subcommittee to work on standardizing distributed schemas (15m, Jeff)

- There has been a lot of new excitement across the community around
  standardizing on an approach for working with distributed schemas, ranging
  from Open Federation to Fusion
- We (Apollo) are excited about these developments, and are looking forward to
  working with others on this standardization approach
- We haven't seen the afore mentioned standardization efforts be brought to the
  Working Group yet, so we'd like to get the ball rolling and start discussions
- Should we start
  the[ composite schema](https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg)
  subcommittee back up, to collaborate more closely? Or would folks like to
  explore an alternative approach?
  - Benjie reopened composite schema working group
- Regardless, let's get the discussions going - super exciting!
- Needed less time than expected, was able to clarify issues prior to the
  meeting

## Review previous meeting's action items (30m, Benjie)

- [#1345](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1345) - everyone review
  default value validation
  - Sufficient review time has
    elapsed;[ RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/793) is at stage
    2 already - needs GraphQL.js merge for stage 3
  - No objections, RFC moves forward
- [#695](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/695) - no @skip/@include
  on subscriptions - raise GraphQL.js PR
  - [GraphQL.js PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3974) raised
  - Can we bump[ RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/860) to RFC2?
  - No objections, moves forward to RFC2
- [#1331](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1331) - if interface
  field deprecated, then object field should be deprecated
  - [Spec PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1053)
    and[ GraphQL.js PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3986) raised
  - Advance to RFC1?
  - No objections, RFC moves forward
- [#1336](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1336) - coercing variable
  values in lists; clarify spec text
  - Discussed December 2022, but the issue was misinterpreted; it relates to
    variables inside lists, not in arguments directly
  - Spec editorial
    PR:[ fix bug in list coercion example table](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1057/files)
  - Agenda item below: "Detail variables in list input coercion rules"
  - Concerns that people may have implemented GraphQL engines incorrectly based
    on the example provided rather than the language as the spec
  - PR will be left open another week so people can respond
- [#1414](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1414) - example of
  executing selection set serially, readers expect an operation; clarify
  - Spec editorial
    PR:[ define "selection set" and clarify examples in section 6](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1032)
  - Previously didn’t have a definition of what a selection set is
  - Looking for approval from a few TSC members before merging
- [#1337](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1337) - forbid nullable
  variable with default in non-nullable position
  - Agenda item below: "Introduce Strict and Legacy All Variable Usages Are
    Allowed validation rules"
  - Meets criteria for RFC1, moves forward
- [#1413](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1413) - close all aging
  action items
  - [Stale closed items](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Astale+)
  - Note: not all items closed were "action items"
- [All open action items (by last update)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Action+item+%3Aclapper%3A%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- [All open action items (by meeting)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/projects?type=classic&query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

## Fix bug in CoerceArgumentValues() algorithm (10m, Benjie)

- [Spec PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1056)
- No GraphQL.js PR needed, GraphQL.js already implements the correct behavior
- Spec bug: RFC process, or editorial?
- Walked through the Spec PR
- Graphql.js and graphql.net don’t suffer from this bug. Their implementations
  do not strictly follow the text of the spec.
- Moves forward to RFC1.

## Detail variables in list input coercion rules (15m, Benjie)

- [Spec PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1058)
- GraphQL.js already implements the correct behavior?
- Previously discussed (but incorrectly interpreted) in December
  2022:[ https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/notes/2022/2022-12.md?rgh-link-date=2023-07-08T08%3A09%3A10Z#field-error-resulting-from-insufficient-validation-of-variables-15m-benjie](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/notes/2022/2022-12.md?rgh-link-date=2023-07-08T08%3A09%3A10Z#field-error-resulting-from-insufficient-validation-of-variables-15m-benjie)
- Not really changing behavior, just defining the status quo... Editorial, or
  RFC process?
- Moving to RFC1.
- Benjie: Has anyone been bitten by this issue?
  - Matt: Yes, but most of my product people don’t use lists. This feature is
    underused, so it’s also under-specced.

## Introduce Strict and Legacy All Variable Usages Are Allowed validation rules (15m, Benjie)

- [Spec PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1059)
- Aim: before I go about implementing this in GraphQL.js, are we agreed this is
  the right solution? RFC1?
- Question: should we enable the new algorithm by default in the next major bump
  of GraphQL.js, and enable users to opt-in to the old version if they need to?
- Reviewed Spec PR
- We need a good migration story where we make it opt in one release, and then
  opt out the next release
- Michael: opt-in/out on a per-request basis (e.g. via a header)
- It’s important that all existing queries continue to work against an existing
  server as its schema evolves
- Moved to RFC1
- Looking for an alternative solution, none brought up in the meeting other than
  doing nothing and allowing the bug to continue to exist
