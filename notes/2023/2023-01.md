- None ready for review and packed agenda, so leaving for next time.

## Updates on [Fragment Arguments](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3152) (15m, Matt)

- [Updated Spec PR to include spec text changes](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/865)
- [Updated graphql-js with working implementation and validation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3152)
- Discuss whether Fragment Arguments PR is ready for
  [Stage 2: Draft](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#stage-2-draft).
- Matt: Fragments don’t give you a way to reuse them in different contexts -
  e.g. a fancy component in React could have N of my friends in a list. In
  GraphQL I either have to push the logic up to where the query is or hard-code
  a value to decide how many friends I want to show. Relay has
  non-spec-compliant directives (`@arguments(nFriends: 10)`) - types that can’t
  be described in GraphQL’s type system.
- Desire is to bring fragment arguments into the spec to get rid of
  non-spec-compliant directives system from Relay. I’d have been happy with just
  adding the AST nodes, but pushback was that the executor should understand
  them, so this RFC addresses this.
- Define fragment arguments in similar ways to variables definition
  (`fragment FriendsList($nFriends:Int!) …`), but when you call them it’s like
  arguments to a field `...FriendsList(nFriends: $someVar)`.
- Lee: it might be easier to think of them as “fragment variables” rather than
  “fragment arguments” - they behave like variables inside the fragment.
- Matt: when dealing with validation, I wanted the AST to be more like “input
  values” - these are almost identical to variable definitions, except they have
  no dollar.
- Lee: it’s kind of both - an argument is a property of how it is called.
  “Fragment variables operate like operation variables; you provide operation
  variables by passing them in the GraphQL request, you provide fragment
  variables by passing as an argument to the fragment spread”
- Matt: scope of fragment variables is local to the fragment only - they are not
  inherited by child fragment spreads; variables can be shadowed.
- Lee: variables defined in fragment are considered first, in the operation
  later. We don’t need to track a stack of variables.
- Matt: this also prevents independent fragments being used in the same document
  from introducing new constraints on those fragments.
- **ACTION** - Matt: switch from “argument definitions” to “variable
  definitions” (using args at the call site still) in a stacked PR
- Ivan: will you be adding a validation rule in Facebook to prevent shadowing?
  Also, consider using a different symbol such as `$$` to make it clear it’s
  fragment local and to allow consistent syntax.
- Matt: it’s not shadowing _within_ a function [...] Within Meta we would not
  add this kind of validation.
- Ivan: if you’re expecting some more validations to come, could you add them to
  the document?
- Matt: I feel this is close to RFC 2 now.
- Lee: I think you probably are at Stage 2. Would be good to separate out the
  RFC doc from the spec edits to keep the PR clean.
- Looks good, choices seem reasonable, would be nice to list out a TODO list of
  the open questions that still need resolving.
- Lee: not quite stage 2 because we’ve not resolved all the challenges, but
  we’re very close!
- Hugh: Apollo Client would love to work with you on this
- Rob: same fragment spread in the same place with different arguments would be
  a validation error?
- [discussion - consensus: TBD]
- Roman: we should be forgiving and accept what the programmer tells us, do our
  best to merge
- Matt: we’ve found that it’s almost always unintentional with fields -
  typically when two teams add different
- **ACTION** - Matt: figure out and document what all the challenges are that
  need to be resolved

## Review of pending approved PRs (15m, Roman)

- making this regular part of agenda
- PRs ready to go:
  - [974](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/974),
  - [975](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/975),
  - [979](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/979),
  - [981](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/981);
- Calling for action to:
  - [983](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/983),
  - [984](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/984),
  - [986](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/986)
- Roman: having PRs open for a long time after being accepted is frustrating -
  can we review them each month and get them merged?
- Lee: editorial PRs shouldn’t need to wait on me; if something is obviously
  ready to merge and non-controversial then TSC members should be able to merge
  them.
- Roman: the other items I’d like to draw your attention to.
- Ivan: for non-editorial changes, having a champion is a good thing, we
  shouldn’t change the process here.
- Lee: if a TSC member approves something that they believe is editorial then
  they can merge it, if they think it needs more discussion they can ping TSC.
  - When you approve, add a line of text detailing what the next action should
    be: are you waiting on more approvals? Does Lee need to review it? Etc. At
    least this way it will be clear whose fault it is for not taking the next
    action.
  - It’s entirely reasonable to want two sets of eyes on each thing.

## Default Value Validation Status Check (15m, Yaacov)

- [Lee's original PR stack](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3049)
- [Now rebased on main](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3814)
- [Reference from 2021](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/6cb3298d3a4e4667bd5f85da9e9676d407ba4e55/notes/2021/2021-09-02.md?plain=1#L123-L128)
- Yaacov: I’ve rebased all your hard work, Lee. Last discussed Sept 2021.
- Benjie [chat]:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/879](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/879)
- Benjie: there’s also the spec work that I think needs to be re-edited to
  mirror what the JS implementation does because I think you changed approach?
- Lee: it’s waiting on me then.
- Ivan: we’ll try and extract any non-spec changes to make the PR smaller. Last
  time I tried to understand it, it was pretty complex. One thing to make the
  review easier might be to see what Andi did in GraphQL-Java - did he encounter
  any issues? Did he do the GraphQL.js code or the spec text?
- Yaacov: schema coordinates are tied into that, is that ready to go?
- Lee: hopefully they can be separated.

## Updates on defer/stream (15m, Rob)

- [Proposal to merge deferred fragments](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/52#discussioncomment-4479271)
- Rob: we had another breakout meeting shortly before the holidays. We’re
  meeting again on Monday
- Recap:
  - Clients being unable to tell if a fragment was deferred or not is still the
    main issue.
  - Generally people aren’t happy with labels, so we’re looking for ways to drop
    it, if possible.
  - In GraphQL we can branch execution on fields via aliases, but we don’t have
    that same option for fragments (at least not yet).
  - General consensus: non-aliased fragments that are deferred should be merged.
- Lee: are you completely removing label, or just making it very optional?
- Rob: dropping it entirely, and it can be solved either via fragment aliases or
  by aliasing the parent field.
- Michael: label was never enough for what we wanted to do anyway, so it feels
  not right to have the label there.
- Lee: we can always add functionality that results in multiple payloads instead
  of one - it’s always better to start with fewer payloads, simpler. In future
  we might consider priority and other options, so I’m in favor with this
  merging.
- Michael: the aggressive merging feels more GraphQL-y
- Rob: complexity is not fetching things again just because they’re deferred.
- Rob: you mentioned “id”, Lee, I’m not totally sold in either direction.
