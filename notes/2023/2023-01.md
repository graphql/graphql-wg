- [All open action items (by meeting)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc)
- None ready for review and packed agenda, so leaving for next time.

## Updates on [Fragment Arguments](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3152) (15m, Matt)

- [Updated Spec PR to include spec text changes](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/865)
- [Updated graphql-js with working implementation and validation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3152)
- Discuss whether Fragment Arguments PR is ready for
  [Stage 2: Draft](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#stage-2-draft).
- Matt: Fragments don’t give you a way to reuse them in different contexts -
  e.g. a fancy component in React could have N of my friends in a list. In
  GraphQL I either have to push the logic up to where the query is or hard-code
  a value to decide how many friends I want to show. Relay has
  non-spec-compliant directives (`@arguments(nFriends: 10)`) - types that can’t
  be described in GraphQL’s type system.
- Desire is to bring fragment arguments into the spec to get rid of
  non-spec-compliant directives system from Relay. I’d have been happy with just
  adding the AST nodes, but pushback was that the executor should understand
  them, so this RFC addresses this.
- Define fragment arguments in similar ways to variables definition
  (`fragment FriendsList($nFriends:Int!) …`), but when you call them it’s like
  arguments to a field `...FriendsList(nFriends: $someVar)`.
- Lee: it might be easier to think of them as “fragment variables” rather than
  “fragment arguments” - they behave like variables inside the fragment.
- Matt: when dealing with validation, I wanted the AST to be more like “input
  values” - these are almost identical to variable definitions, except they have
  no dollar.
- Lee: it’s kind of both - an argument is a property of how it is called.
  “Fragment variables operate like operation variables; you provide operation
  variables by passing them in the GraphQL request, you provide fragment
  variables by passing as an argument to the fragment spread”
- Matt: scope of fragment variables is local to the fragment only - they are not
  inherited by child fragment spreads; variables can be shadowed.
- Lee: variables defined in fragment are considered first, in the operation
  later. We don’t need to track a stack of variables.
- Matt: this also prevents independent fragments being used in the same document
  from introducing new constraints on those fragments.
- **ACTION** - Matt: switch from “argument definitions” to “variable
  definitions” (using args at the call site still) in a stacked PR
- Ivan: will you be adding a validation rule in Facebook to prevent shadowing?
  Also, consider using a different symbol such as `$$` to make it clear it’s
  fragment local and to allow consistent syntax.
- Matt: it’s not shadowing _within_ a function [...] Within Meta we would not
  add this kind of validation.
- Ivan: if you’re expecting some more validations to come, could you add them to
  the document?
- Matt: I feel this is close to RFC 2 now.
- Lee: I think you probably are at Stage 2. Would be good to separate out the
  RFC doc from the spec edits to keep the PR clean.
- Looks good, choices seem reasonable, would be nice to list out a TODO list of
  the open questions that still need resolving.
- Lee: not quite stage 2 because we’ve not resolved all the challenges, but
  we’re very close!
- Hugh: Apollo Client would love to work with you on this
- Rob: same fragment spread in the same place with different arguments would be
  a validation error?
- [discussion - consensus: TBD]
- Roman: we should be forgiving and accept what the programmer tells us, do our
  best to merge
- Matt: we’ve found that it’s almost always unintentional with fields -
  typically when two teams add different
- **ACTION** - Matt: figure out and document what all the challenges are that
  need to be resolved

## Review of pending approved PRs (15m, Roman)

- making this regular part of agenda
- PRs ready to go:
  - [974](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/974),
  - [975](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/975),
  - [979](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/979),
  - [981](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/981);
- Calling for action to:
  - [983](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/983),
  - [984](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/984),
  - [986](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/986)
- Roman: having PRs open for a long time after being accepted is frustrating -
  can we review them each month and get them merged?
- Lee: editorial PRs shouldn’t need to wait on me; if something is obviously
  ready to merge and non-controversial then TSC members should be able to merge
  them.
- Roman: the other items I’d like to draw your attention to.
- Ivan: for non-editorial changes, having a champion is a good thing, we
  shouldn’t change the process here.
- Lee: if a TSC member approves something that they believe is editorial then
  they can merge it, if they think it needs more discussion they can ping TSC.
  - When you approve, add a line of text detailing what the next action should
    be: are you waiting on more approvals? Does Lee need to review it? Etc. At
    least this way it will be clear whose fault it is for not taking the next
    action.
  - It’s entirely reasonable to want two sets of eyes on each thing.

## Default Value Validation Status Check (15m, Yaacov)

- [Lee's original PR stack](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3049)
- [Now rebased on main](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3814)
- [Reference from 2021](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/6cb3298d3a4e4667bd5f85da9e9676d407ba4e55/notes/2021/2021-09-02.md?plain=1#L123-L128)
- Yaacov: I’ve rebased all your hard work, Lee. Last discussed Sept 2021.
- Benjie [chat]:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/879](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/879)
- Benjie: there’s also the spec work that I think needs to be re-edited to
  mirror what the JS implementation does because I think you changed approach?
- Lee: it’s waiting on me then.
- Ivan: we’ll try and extract any non-spec changes to make the PR smaller. Last
  time I tried to understand it, it was pretty complex. One thing to make the
  review easier might be to see what Andi did in GraphQL-Java - did he encounter
  any issues? Did he do the GraphQL.js code or the spec text?
- Yaacov: schema coordinates are tied into that, is that ready to go?
- Lee: hopefully they can be separated.

## Updates on defer/stream (15m, Rob)

- [Proposal to merge deferred fragments](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/52#discussioncomment-4479271)
- Rob: we had another breakout meeting shortly before the holidays. We’re
  meeting again on Monday
- Recap:
  - Clients being unable to tell if a fragment was deferred or not is still the
    main issue.
  - Generally people aren’t happy with labels, so we’re looking for ways to drop
    it, if possible.
  - In GraphQL we can branch execution on fields via aliases, but we don’t have
    that same option for fragments (at least not yet).
  - General consensus: non-aliased fragments that are deferred should be merged.
- Lee: are you completely removing label, or just making it very optional?
- Rob: dropping it entirely, and it can be solved either via fragment aliases or
  by aliasing the parent field.
- Michael: label was never enough for what we wanted to do anyway, so it feels
  not right to have the label there.
- Lee: we can always add functionality that results in multiple payloads instead
  of one - it’s always better to start with fewer payloads, simpler. In future
  we might consider priority and other options, so I’m in favor with this
  merging.
- Michael: the aggressive merging feels more GraphQL-y
- Rob: complexity is not fetching things again just because they’re deferred.
- Rob: you mentioned “id”, Lee, I’m not totally sold in either direction.

   (5m, Donna)
8. [Fragment Arguments](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/865):
   Identify Open Concerns to Address (known concerns below) (10m, Matt)
   - Do we allow shadowing global variables?
   - PR with Variable Definitions instead of Fragment Argument Definitions.
   - Do we need PR Reviews to know if there are other concerns?
   - Maybe: additional graphql-js PR to use local scope, aka graphql-spec
     algorithm, rather than visit replacement?

## Review Agenda

- Updates on things from first-week wg (see
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/01-Jan/11-wg-secondary-apac.md](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/01-Jan/11-wg-secondary-apac.md))

## Review previous meeting's action items

- Andi: Benjie had validation Q for default value handling, GraphQL Java now
  implements all default value validation
- Andi: needed additional function for scalars value to AST
- Influenced custom scalar work

## Licensing & final legal sign-off for GraphQL Scalars project

- Waiting for Lee
- Spend time in meeting getting to done.
- License:
  - MIT License (it’s code not spec text). Need to add that because scalars is
    code, but owfa is for spec text. Weird reasons why different. Need template
    about copyright person who wrote, but open to all
  - Andi: OWFA is ideal as mostly it’s spec, even though we have some code.
    Value is spec not code
  - Lee: Will say any code is MIT, any spec is OWFA. Will do this right after
    call
- Donna: in custom scalars section of spec, could link to GraphQL Scalars
- Andi: spread word, use it, look into it, let’s get value out of it
- Lee: will pull down now

## Fragment Arguments Open Concerns

- Extra thing: open new PR to kill and make new one to help improve context
- Discussion about how we do it on the client (expanding fragments as templates)
- Worthwhile to treat runtime performance of validation steps as legitimate
  concern
  - Could we dream up degenerate text that causes perf issues? Does this create
    a new category of these things? Would be good to have a paragraph or two
    explaining why we aren’t worried about it.

   (20m, Roman)

## Review prior primary meeting

- Talked about fragment arguments, need to resolve naming around arguments or
  variables
- Discussion about PR’s for the spec being approved but not merged; when someone
  approves they should make the next steps clear, e.g. approved and should be
  merged, approved but needs more feedback from other TSC members, etc.
- Default value validation status checks
  ([https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3814](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3814))
- Defer/stream updates

## Defer/Stream updates

- Summary: clients identifying streams/defers being in progress/completed.
- Rob: I've broken the
  [#52](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/52)
  discussions up into separate issues.
  - Remove labels entirely
    [#64](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/64)
    - Ivan: If we have initial response and one big defer per path then you can
      live without labels, but labels are a nice feature - they make the client
      life easier and allow us to do more complicated stuff later.
    - Michael: I don't see the use cases for labels, could you expand?
    - Ivan: currently we'd only get one defer per path, but with labels you can
      ship data as you want and just mark when certain labels are resolved.
    - Michael: but it reintroduces all the label issues?
    - Ivan: we can use labels in a different way than what we proposed
      previously; I'll open a separate issue to discuss this.
    - Hugh: add them to #64
    - Yaacov [chat]: labels allow you to declare fulfillment of defers at the
      same path individually => but what we said previously is that we would
      enable this eventually with fragment aliases
    - Rob: a single defer could correspond to multiple responses, and the label
      would indicate once all the responses mean that that label is completed.
    - Ivan: exactly: server ships stuff when it's ready - shipping fields
      separately or batching - then label indicates that you have everything
      that you need to satisfy the fragment.
    - Michael: we're hoping to solve this with fragment aliasing instead, then
      you would not need the label.
    - Rob: the important thing to me here is changing the contract that you can
      have one defer per path.
    - Ivan: Apollo Kotlin works on a merged tree of all the payloads, it doesn't
      matter how it's received (which payloads have which fields) - it just
      matters if the data is complete or not [for a label].
    - Ivan: this proposal splits the idea of the label and the shape being
      paired - the shape can be split and delivered in multiple parts, and then
      signal when it's complete.
    - Ivan: reason: deduplication and allowing details at the same path to be
      resolved in different phases
    - Yaacov: but we may be able to solve that in different ways.
    - Ivan: you're right; deduplication is the main one for me.
  - Deduplication of deferred fields
    [#65](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/65)
  - Include an indication of upcoming payloads in response
    [#66](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg/discussions/66)

## Discussion of Backward Compatibility

- Roman: Sometimes "backwards compatibility" gets in the way - if someone
  mentions that then it can stop progress..
- Related discussion:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1232](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1232)
- Benjie: deprecated directive doesn’t mean the thing has to go away, or that
  there is going to be an incompatible change
- Benjie: I do like the suggested new wording: “@directive directive helps to
  manage the gradual evolution of application schema, giving an advanced warning
  to clients about upcoming changes in the schema.”
- Ivan: I suggest "deprecated" discourage usage in a new client and notify old
  client to migrate
  - so no mention of compatibility
  - because it's up to a server maintainer to decide on such a policy
- Benjie: re: deprecated, it doesn't mean "it might go away," it means "avoid
  using this." It _might_ mean that it's going to go away, but that's up to the
  schema implementer. It might just mean there's an alternative field/pattern to
  use instead.
- Backwards compatibility explained in
  https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#guiding-principles:
  - Once a query is written, it should always mean the same thing and return the
    same shaped result. Future changes should not change the meaning of existing
    schema or requests or in any other way cause an existing compliant GraphQL
    service to become non-compliant for prior versions of the spec.
  - Folks agree with this
- Moving conversation to talk about suggested basic principles for advancing the
  spec (from Roman):
  1. Capabilities: do not remove, add only. Do not change, extend only
  2. Restrictions on existing elements: never add one, but removing restriction
     should be OK.
  3. Presumed some tolerance of implementations to unexpected extra elements -
     do we mention it in the spec?
  4. Primary concern with existing end apps and their GraphQL schemas and
     queries;
  5. Much less concern with libraries and tools, just publish spec draft early
     enough.
- Yaacov: so that means there can never be any new GraphQL Types?....; That
  can't be interpreted by old GraphiQL as an old type?
- Benjie: It's a _should_, so basically care must be taken. GraphiQL _should_
  ignore types it doesn't understand, in the same way that that apps should
  expect new types to be added to a union.; However changing that an input
  object is no longer input-only would be an unexpected change rather than a new
  type. In general a new type is actually preferred over tweaking existing
  types.
- Ivan: Future changes should not change the meaning of existing schema
- Benjie: conversation is getting a bit convoluted between backwards and
  forwards compatibility

## Update on Fragment Arguments

- New discussion placeholder:
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1239](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1239)
  - Questions, comments, concerns go here
- Making progress, would love to get feedback on
  [graphql/graphql-js#3835](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3835) and
  [graphql/graphql-spec#1010](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1010)
- Matt is working with the Relay team on making sure the solution / approach is
  feasible
