Agenda:
[https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/07-Jul/06-wg-primary.md](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/07-Jul/06-wg-primary.md)

## Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Lee)

- Benjie

## Review agenda (2m, Lee)

- NOTE: YouTube videos are now up to date, Benjie has semi-automated the upload
  process so we should be able to keep them much more in sync in future

## Review prior secondary meetings (5m, Lee)

- [June WG Secondary, APAC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/06-Jun/07-wg-secondary-apac.md)
- [June WG Secondary, EU](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/agendas/2023/06-Jun/15-wg-secondary-eu.md)
- Meetings have been cancelled recently due to lack of agenda - are they still
  needed? Yes, just everyone is busy on @stream/@defer right now.

## Review previous meeting's action items (5m, Lee)

- [Ready for review](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Ready+for+review+%F0%9F%99%8C%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- [All open action items (by last update)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Action+item+%3Aclapper%3A%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- [All open action items (by meeting)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc)
- Lots of other things are still on the back burner: client controlled
  nullability, fragment isolation, input unions / @oneOf, schema coordinates,
  etc - at the moment most contributor work is going into the incremental
  delivery work.
- oneOf was recently merged to graphql-js. Has been supported in HotChocolate
  for 1.5 years

## Client Controlled Nullability (10m)

- Issue with CCN was around bubbling and syntax. Main issue is that Alex isn't
  currently able to champion it, but was held back by slow interactions with
  Relay team - would be great to get faster feedback/iteration.
- Clients like Relay won't be able to take advantage of CCN without compiling it
  away and reimplementing on the client to give fragment isolation.
- Relay can interpret the developer demand rather than passing it through, and
  already does similar things with client-side directives, so we could see CCN
  as just a tool to be enabled by frameworks.
- To merge CCN before fragment modularity, we need to be sure it won't block
  fragment modularity in future.
- Consensus was that it's okay for Relay to wipe it all away, but if all clients
  have to do that it would lose a lot of its value.

## TSC mailing list

- TSC mailing list was out of date. Benjie and Jory have been working together
  to get things up to date, but we're concerned we don't have the best email
  address for TSC members. TSC members: please send Benjie (DM on Discord,
  Twitter, or email him) your best email address.
- TSC members: if you're not in the TSC chat in Discord, please reach out to
  Benjie (via Discord).
- Are we using the right communication channels? Should we re-introduce slack
  but on a smaller basis for just project chat? Probably not, because WG work
  should be open.

## Defer execution model - Early vs Delayed (30m, Rob)

- Early execution kicks off resolver execution for deferred fields before the
  previous response is finished building.
- Deferred execution wants until the previous response is finished before
  running resolvers for deferred fields.
- Deferred execution can increase total request latency.
- Early execution can cause the initial payload to be slower.
- We could indicate to resolvers that they're deferred and allow them to make
  choices based around this.
- With deferred execution, there's significantly reduced complexity around error
  boundaries/bubbling - things will simply not queue to execute in the first
  place.
- What should we specify?
- If we specify deferred execution then people might write queries that depend
  on that, and if we do early execution it might break this expectation.
- [All participants were very involved in the discussion, so no-one was able to
  take further notes. Please see the YouTube video
