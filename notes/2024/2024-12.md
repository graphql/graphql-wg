2. Introduction of attendees (5m, Host)
3. Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Host)
4. Review agenda (2m, Host)
5. Check
   for[ ready for review agenda items](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Ready+for+review+%F0%9F%99%8C%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
   (5m, Host)
6. [Move January meeting to Jan 9?](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/pull/1595)
   (1m, Benjie)
   - Group agreed
7. TSC membership vote - open for nominations (2m, Host)
   - [Election process](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#election-process)
   - Anyone can self-nominate or nominate others
   - Lee to open the nomination form and share out
   - Andy, Kewei, Rob, Stephen, Uri‚Äôs terms are set to end (re-nomination is of
     course open to them)
8. Add 'extensions' to request (2m, Benjie)
   - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/976) - promote to RFC 2?
     (Does it actually _need_ any code changes?)
   - Benjie: Not really meaningful to spec - reserve space for tools/vendors to
     extend
   - Adds a challenge RE: various transports - defining it over and over again
   - Proposing (a) advance to RFC2 (b) acknowledge no code changes needed
   - Lee: seems like a slam-dunk change
9. Make `deprecated.reason` non-null (5m, Martin)
   - spec
     edits:[ graphql/graphql-spec#1040](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1040)
   - graphql-js pull
     request:[ graphql/graphql-js#4299 (review)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4299#pullrequestreview-2455415595)
   - Martin: Did a PR to graphql-js
   - That‚Äôs all I have
   - Lee: repeating back, it sounds like since we‚Äôre saying that because
     `reason` has a default value, we should disallow the ability to use
     `null`-literal as a value, which is technically possible if `reason` is
     nullable
   - Matt: not possible to send a request with deprecated from clients, yes?
   - Lee: should only impact tooling
   - Lee: approved and merging - awaiting graphql-js maintainers
10. Add a validation rule that operation types exist (5m, Benjie)
    - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/955) - promote to RFC
      2?
    - Proposal to add a new validation rule - does an operation type exist
    - Lee: agreed, suggests moving to ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù
    - Lee: will do offline review, want to accept and merge
    -
11. Change 'original' to 'previous' to clarify multiple extensions (5m, Benjie)
    - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1123) - editorial;
      merge?
    - Benjie: When extending types, we use the term ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù but we allow for
      multiple extensions. This can be confusing.
      - This allows for something invalid:
        1. union MyUnion = Foo
        2. extend union MyUnion = Bar | Baz
        3. extend union MyUnion = Bar | Qux
    - Let‚Äôs wait 2 weeks and then we can merge
12. GraphQL-JS maintenance (10m, Jovi)
    - Who has access to Netlify and how can we disconnect it
      - Nobody knows on the call
      - Maybe Ivan?
      - Uri says he might have access üéâ
    - What are our expectations of GraphQL.JS (frequency of publishing, docs,
      ...)
      - We‚Äôve never declared LTS/EOL stuff
      - In practice, we‚Äôve generally put our energy into new versions
      - Have we backported releases to prior majors?
      - Yes, recently with introspection fix
      - Lee: open to any reasonable proposal here
      - Matt: one bare minimum is when we switched from Flow to TS
      - Lenz: adding some concern to that - GraphQL versions can tend to take a
        long time - maybe majors released in the last two years - plenty of time
        to migrate over - could also be another time frame
      - Gives people some security
      - Jovi: for clarity, in our case, v16 would be immediately dropped
      - Lee: something like adding a time window
    - When do we want v17
      - Jovi: Several specs ongoing
      - Rob: defer/stream in v17 - not exposed by regular execution function
      - If we were to release v17, we would not open up defer/stream - still
        experimental in that release
      - Yaacov: to clarify that post - where do we need to be in terms of our
        approval process to defer/stream to release v17?
      - Implicit in your answer, Rob, is that we could be anywhere
      - Let‚Äôs say we were ready after the holidays, could we move then?
      - Rob: I was more hesitant when we were more actively iterating in the
        past year
      - It‚Äôs still being behind the experimental function - giving ourselves the
        opportunity to change things if needed
      - Jeff: asked about the ability to keep w/ a previous incremental
        transport protocol with adopting v17
      - Lenz: multiple flags might add bundle size, etc
      - Rob: might be hard to incentivize adopting if folks feel like they have
        something working already
      - Benjie: we can continue this discussion for sure - backports to v16 will
        be there for a while, nothing urgent
      - From chat via Yaacov: 4. is there a way to preserve both the old format
        and the current format of defer/stream? yes, technically, for sure 5.
        https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/pull/6243 this PR allows
        toggles for the old spec format and the new format 6. (it's a PR to a
        fork of the executor maintained by the guild) 7. see this comment: 8.
        `ts 9. const result = await execute({ 10. ..., 11. incrementalPreset: 'v17.0.0-alpha.2', 12. }); 13. ` 14.
        [https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/pull/6243#discussion_r1704241110](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/pull/6243#discussion_r1704241110)
      - Lenz: 15. The problem is that we either have to ship many different
        versions of HttpLink, which is very confusing for users, or one version
        that grows bigger and bigger that cannot treeshake. 16. I'm less
        concerned on the server side than on the client side
    - Should we start EOL'ing releases
13. Implementations may not deprecate a field that the interface hasn't
    deprecated (10m, Benjie)
    - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1053) - promote to
      RFC2?
    - Lee to give inline feedback
14. `@defer`/`@stream` updates (10m, Rob)
    - Editorial: move "Path" to it's own
      section[ graphql/graphql-spec#1129](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1129)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
      </span>
      - Helps us reference that area in defer/stream down the line
    - Please continue
      reviewing[ graphql/graphql-spec#1124](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1124)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
      </span>
    - Rob: Current stage is RFC1, a prior design was in RFC2
    - Benjie: RFC2 is ‚Äúpreferred solution‚Äù and the current spec edits get us
      closer to that
    - Lee: generally in support of calling this RFC2 - pretty confident this is
      the right path
15. Merge
    Lee's[ Editorial changes for Event Streams](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1099)?
    (10m, Benjie)
    - Benjie: recap
16. When `sourceStream` errors, yield a `{ errors: [...] }` response (5m,
    Benjie)
    - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1127) - promote to RFC
      1?
    - Lenz: may impact current behavior for clients initiating restarts (longer
      conversation, refer to recording as I did not annotate the conversation)
17. Fix CoerceArgumentValues()' hasValue (15m, Benjie)
    - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1056) - promote to
      RFC2? Merge as an editorial fix?
18. Be explicit about list coercion (15m, Benjie)
    - [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1058) - promote to
      RFC2? Merge as an editorial fix?
    - Lee to review
19. Interface field argument default values (@yaacovCR, 30m)
    - Spec
      bug?[ graphql/graphql-spec#1121](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/1121)
    - (Yaacov talks through the PR)
    - Essentially: the identified gap may lead to runtime errors in ways that
      may betray the intent of the schema author
    - Benjie: (talks through their comment on the PR): essentially adding a
      default in a way that is non-breaking for clients, but with a
      recommendation of a stricter implementation that may require client-side
      changes RE: defaults
    - No bar for RFC0 so we can deem it so, RFC1 would entail spec wording
      adjustments
