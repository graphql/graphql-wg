## Editorial change to "composite" term (2m, Jovi)

- [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1078](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1078)

## Editorial: show how the parts of a request are passed to ExecuteRequest (5m, Benjie)

- [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1090](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1090)
- Discussed in the April WG
- Wanted to define “extensions”
- This now explicitly calls it with all the named parameters
- Sets us up for future changes to be smaller

## Move Fragment Arguments RFC to RFC2? (10m, Jovi)

- [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1081](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1081)
- Matt: There no remaining major pieces that are left unbuilt. Minor issues to
  be worked on before acceptance
- Lee: I think this means we’re really close, and we just need validator
- Matt: Ready to push to RFC2 as soon as we have that
- Rob: With GraphQL.js there was an issue with large arguments. Is that still an
  issue?
- Jovi: I believe we don’t serialize and just use names now
- Benjie: I think we can do it purely on the the name now for preventing
  recursion
- Lee: We previously discussed that it’s a validation error to use a fragment in
  the same selection set with different arguments (similar to fields). With
  fields you would use field aliases, so that naturally leads to the idea of
  fragment aliases.

## Define data collections used in the spec (10m, Benjie)

- Benjie: in the April WG we discussed that we don’t state the order of things
  very well
- Benjie: could you just return the result in random order for the introspection
  etc
- Benjie: we are working to making this clear, we broadly define what a list/map
  is
