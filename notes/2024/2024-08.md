- Jovi: _Do we want to backport to GraphQL 16?_
- Jovi: _Are we ready to advance to RFC2? _
- Michael: Was thinking variable scoping could be difficult in execution. That
  is the main concern for me. I will look at that.
- Michael: I recall three problems that Joe Savona said about GraphQL and this
  was one of them. This will be awesome
- Jovi: As a client, this has come up quite a bit as well
