**Watch the replays:**
[GraphQL Working Group Meetings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foH30_sDnEZnxV_8pYW3SDtb)

## Request for feedback on graphql-js change regarding "dev-mode" detection (process.env, globalThis.process.env) (2m, Benjie)

- [graphql/graphql-js#4075](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/4075)
- If you are impacted by this, please take a look and give us feedback, we want
  to make a decision next GraphQL-JS-WG Meeting.
- Notes:
  - Benjie: `instanceof` checks - if you’re familiar with Node, you know the
    “dual package hazard” endemic to ESM/CJS
  - Different solutions proposed to problem in the link - please do weigh in on
    this issue
  - Next GraphQL.js WG we will make a decision and ship it - so please do weigh
    in!

## Restricting graphql-js exports to one or few entry points. (2m, Jeff)

- [graphql/graphql-js#4074](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/4074)
- Looking for feedback from dependent library authors if they would be impacted
  by this change and if someone has specific concerns.
- Please do check your projects and copypaste the template into this issue
- Matt: we could probably list everything as an export path
- Would be useful if there was a script to fix on upgrade to fix all package
  imports
- Might ease adoption of a version bump - (like a codemod?)
