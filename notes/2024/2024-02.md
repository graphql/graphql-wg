## TSC updates (5m, Lee)

- [Election conclusion](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1446)
- TSC &lt;> Foundation Board
- Two things happening:
  - TSC election process complete. 4 members re-elected.
  - Marc-Andre has stepped down (thanks for everything you did, especially for
    the conference).
  - New member Denis (thank him for submitting his name!)
  - 2: Foundation has two halves: WG does technical stuff, Foundation Board
    determines how to spend the money to do marketing, conferences, bringing the
    community together. I'd like these two halfs to be brought together this
    year. We'd love to get more visibility in both directions. In foundations
    where there isn't separation the vendors in the foundation can get outsized
    sway on the technical side, and we want to avoid that.
  - Plan: ask the TSC to vote for two new members to go to the board meetings,
    and report back to the WGs: what's happening. Also bring feedback to the
    foundation meetings: we need more investment here, etc.

## Call for graphql-js maintainers (5m, Lee/Benjie)

- Benjie: Ivan has recently stepped down as the lead maintainer, after serving
  for many years and having a huge impact.
  - Many other people who have commit & review permissions
  - No one to step into Ivan’s shoes, would love to get more people involved
    with GraphQL JS
  - GraphQL-js working group stopped meeting, folks involved lacked bandwidth
  - Benjie has set up a gql.js working-group, first meeting end of February
    [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg)
  - Encourage everyone to join the gql.js wg
- Lee: Three different buckets of support we need in Graphql-js
  - Helping to manage the community of contributors, Benjie has volunteered to
    do this temporarily. This involves managing GraphQL.js meetings, Technical
    lead type person would be ideal
  - Lead maintainer for graphql-js and also new maintainers in general, group
    has been at its best with multiple maintainers working as a group, call for
    people on your team, … to fill these shoes
    - Call out to ask your co-workers!

## New version for fragment-arguments (5m, Jovi)

- [graphql/graphql-spec#1010](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1010)
- [graphql/graphql-js#4015](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4015)
- Jovi: recently picked up Matt's work on Fragment Arguments. I've split the PR
  into a parser PR and an execution PR. They're ready for review; I have
  addressed the previous comments.
- Jovi: in the current state of the art there was a way of unsetting a variable;
  this isn't represented in the spec text yet but I plan to do so.
- Matt: the remaining PR on top of that is the validation one - that's going to
  be hard!
- Lee: are you just looking for eyeballs?
- Jovi: I'd love to have initial reviews on the parser and execution PRs. For
  validation, there's a lot of open discussion, I'd like to keep the discussion
  going without opening a PR.
- Matt: I might have something floating around; the validation had the most
  iteration that isn't present in the PR. The Relay compiler is a good thing to
  steal from, but has some oddities that we won't want to port into the spec.
- Jovi & Jordan to catch up.
- Lee: are there open questions on the validation front?
- Jovi: there's an ongoing discussion between Lee and Matt.
  - [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3835](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3835)
  - It's not immediately clear how I can address the feedback in the validation
    folder.
- Matt: how they merge is going to be the most complex part. This is one of the
  reasons that fragment aliases might be needed - when merging fields we can
  alias, but with fragments we can't.
- Lee: rather than doing clever merging semantics, bias towards validation
  forbidding complex stuff. "Doesn't match - not allowed." Maybe don't allow
  merging fragment spreads unless they're identical. Feel comfortable
  shortcutting here; does it turn out that doing this makes reasonable use cases
  annoying to accomplish? Diamond dependency patterns?
- Lee: thanks for picking this up, I'm excited to see this progressing!

## Using MUST for error paths (5m, Benoit)

- [graphql/graphql-spec#1073](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1073)
- Benoit: semantic non-nullability - we need to know where the errors live,
  which we use the `path` field on errors... But the spec says `SHOULD` not
  `MUST`! So we're not sure that we can rely on the `path` for this.
- Matt: it's not that "path must exist" it's that "when path exists, it must be
  in the right format"
- Lee: the paragraph before requires that `path` must exist if it can be
  associated with a field.
- Lee: if you want to know what kind of error it is, you sniff its field - if it
  has `path`, we know it's a field execution error. Really we should (haha) have
  error codes.
- Since this is a structural change, we're going to send this through the RFC
  process. It's now RFC 1.
- Common implementations implement it... So now it's RFC2!
- Let's do a double check on the existing implementations.
- **ACTION**: this will go to approved next month assuming it doesn't break
  anything. Implementors, report back if you anticipate issues.
