## [Advance @oneOf to RFC3?](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/825) (10m, Benjie)

- Hesitation from
  Yaacov:[ do we need the new validation rule?](https://github.com/benjie/graphql-spec/pull/1)
- Benjie: I thought we needed this, but Yaacov may be correct
- Might need a slight modification
- There are complexities around variables that can be embedded in a location
  e.g. non-nullable ones
- Michael: is this an implementation details?
- Benjie: I think it’s clear w/ a validation rule but Yaacov points out that if
  people follow the other rules then this one is potentially superfluous.
- Michael: we could advance it and iterate
- Benjie: not a massive rush to push to RFC3 - final editorial
- It would be fine either way prob
- Can change it later if needed

## Incremental Delivery update (15m, Rob)

- [New Spec Draft](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1110)
- Rob:
- New response format (June 2023) has general consensus. This version does not
  duplicate fields when they're both deferred and not deferred.
- Implemented in GraphQL v17 alpha.
- We'd love to get eyes on the spec draft. It's a big PR. Early feedback
  appreciated.
- Plan is to break this down into an integration branch and review it section by
  section in smaller PRs.
- Response section first describes what the response looks like.
- (Benjie) If there are standalone changes to merge into the spec rather than
  integration branch, would be beneficial. General approach you’re proposing
  would be wise

- Kewei: does this apply to defer _and_ stream?
- Rob: Response format covers defer and stream, but the algorithms for stream
  are not here yet
- Kewei: does reviewing the response format make sense if we don't have stream's
  algorithms specified yet?
- Rob: I think it's unlikely the response format will change.
- Rob: I expect the stream diff to be smaller, just a little addition on top.

- Rob: planning to get an integration branch set up for next month with the
  response changes.

## [Replace ExecuteSelectionSet with ExecuteGroupedFieldSet](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1039) (15m, Benjie)

- Needed by Yaacov, Rob and Benjie's various implementations of incremental
  delivery, and also
  by[ Jovi's fragment arguments](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1081#issuecomment-2329504269)
  PR
- Essentially a re-write of some copy for the purpose of naming - helps other
  PRs get through with smaller diffs

## [Fix coercion table for list](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1057/files) - editorial? (10m, Benjie)

- Benjie: Spec table is wrong. Verified GraphQL.js behavior

## [Validate that operation type exists](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1098) (10m, Benjie)

- Kewei: How did we not catch this?
- Matt: I believe Relay’s Rust code would already validate this
- Stephen: Any tool that walks the schema document would have to fail if a
  schema violated this. Perhaps it’s already being validated everywhere even
  though it’s technically never been in the spec.
- Moved from RFC0 to RFC1
