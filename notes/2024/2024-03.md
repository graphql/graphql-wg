  - TSC Elections complete, closed now as discussed as well in last meeting
  - Reminder: check your implementation, error paths changing from a _should_ to
    a _must_
    - Let us know if this would be an issue for your implementation!
  - Request for everyone to review the full schema’s RFC by Martin
    - Closing as an action item and bringing to future WG to discuss again
  - Benjie requested reviews for exclude selection to exclude root set, change
    in algorithms
    - Closed but reviews still appreciated
      [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1039](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1039)
  - Add validations graphql-js deprecated on object still pending

## [GraphQL Grant Refresh](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-03-07-graphql-community-grant-refresh/) (5m, Benjie)

- We have had a grant program running for the past years
- Switching to a continuous process for the grant program
  - You are able to apply at any time
  - Jory and Benjie will function as a first line of filtering
  - Then it goes on to the TSC for review - funding amount, …
- Goal: tighter response time from requesting grant to receiving feedback
- Goal: more transparency
- Any project within the GraphQL organization, code, blog posts, …
  - Example: RFC from a year ago but you had no time to progress, some funding
    might help, please apply!
  - Read the
    [blog post](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-03-07-graphql-community-grant-refresh/)
    and the [application page](https://graphql.org/foundation/community-grant/).

## Strict error paths (5m, Martin)

- [#1073](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1073) - Strict error
  paths
- Context: nullability and errors
- Currently: when an error occurs we should return a path from the
  operation-root to the errored field
- Future: this should would become must
- This helps with strict semantic nullability
- How do we move forward?
  - Matt: 2 TSC approvals - so just get it in?
  - Benjie: we need a quorum of active TSC members, with that we could merge it
  - Benjie: might make sense to wait 1 more month to allow for other
    implementations to provide feedback, merge by next working group
  - Benjie: we have pinged implementors but not much response
  - Martin: GraphQL Java is okay
  - Benjie: we should improve at talking to the implementors of different
    implementations
  - Benjie: Please check in with maintainers for feedback
- **Action item**: Merge this by next working group if no other blocking reviews
  arise
- **Action item**: Reach out to maintainers of different GraphQL implementations
  for feedback on this

## Call for reviews (5m, Jovi)

- [#1078](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1078) - Minor wording
  change
  - **Action item**: Check out wording in GraphQL.js to ensure this wording
    change can’t cause confusion and add non-normative note explaining composite
    referring to object/interface/union
  - Glossary is an interesting idea but a big lift for this one in particular
- [#1081](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1081) - Fragment
  arguments amendments
- [#4015](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4015) - Fragment arguments
  parsing in GraphQL.JS (execution PR linked in description)

## String literal aliases proposal (15m, Curtis, Matt)

- [#1082](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1082) - Proposed spec
  changes for string literal aliases
- [#4023](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4023) - Add parser support
  for string literal aliases
- Big lift, sharing context why and what the problem is.
  - Data consistency, multiple screens fetch data over GraphQL
  - When the data changes we want to be aware of that
  - Queries within the same session should be able to update each other
  - Relay uses a mapping of the alias name to the canonical name
    - fieldName + fieldArguments
  - Right now we are experimenting where we use the alias to encode the
    canonical name, the canonical name can include illegal characters for the
    GraphQL spec due to arguments
    - We are trying to understand whether we can do this without changing the
      spec, experiments with custom escape format “z” is an escape character
      because it’s the least used char in the GraphQL alphabet
    - The alternative is a spec extension that uses a double quote for aliases
      which allows for all characters (string literal aliases)
  - How do folks feel about the issue of data consistency
    - Martin: apollo-kotlin could benefit from this as well as it ships with
      codegen that embeds some of this as well
    - Jovi: how does the normalized cache fall short
    - Matt: It does not, it’s a network optimisation as we have less in memory
      as the canonical name can be pre-computed
    - Stephen: we solved this early at Netflix with Falcor and its JSON graph
      design, going to GraphQL we haven’t done any special workarounds and we
      haven’t seen any regressions there. We have the same need to normalize
      across your experience. In falcor we use references so if you have
      something in your response it’s only in one place.
    - Martin: did you consider something like meta fields `__canonicalName`
    - Matt: that doesn’t work for scalars as we’d need a selectionSet
    - Curtis: internally at meta we have collected a number of features that we
      do that make up this normalized cache ecosystem.
      - Canonical name
      - Strong directive
      - Fetchable directive
    - Curtis: would be valuable to put this more cohesively together within
      GraphQL. Having references in the response and use it only once, we have
      played with this and we named it “graph-mode”. One of the concerns with
      graph-mode was how well it streams.
    - Benjie: posts link to graphql-crunch
      [https://github.com/banterfm/graphql-crunch](https://github.com/banterfm/graphql-crunch)
    - Benjie: GraphQL Crunch is an open implementation of references, have you
      considered building it as a protocol extension on top of GraphQL, adding
      it to the extensions object.
    - Benjie: Name being limited is controversial in GraphQL but the limitation
      makes it work in every programming language.
- Curtis: RFC is a strawman and no intentions of merging it atm, feedback is
  already hugely appreciated!

## Get some of Benjie's editorial PR's merged (15m, Benjie)

- [#1016](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1016) - fix a single word
  - We missed one word replacement, 2 TSC approvals so… merged!
- [#1032](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1032) - define "selection
  set" (already has 2 TSC approvals)
  - This relates to some common misreading of the specification, it talks about
    serial execution of a selection-set. Mutations have serial execution of a
    selection-set, folks get confused when reading the examples as they think
    it’s a query operation using the short-hand.
  - The PR makes the PR’s explicit by either having mutation explicitly or a
    note
  - The PR also explicitly defines selection-set which we were missing in the
    specification
  - Kewei: the mutations are missing variables
  - Benjie: good catch, addressing it!
  - **Action item**: review and get it merged if approved after the above is
    addressed
- [#894](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/894) - clarify "before
  execution starts" still includes the "request error"s that can be raised in
  ExecuteRequest() (variable coercion failure; not exactly one subscription
  field assertion failure)
  - We have text that refers to “before execution begins”, we however don’t
    define that anywhere.
  - In order to help with clarifying the text we add a normative note explaining
    this
- [#1069](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1069) - enforce
  consistent punctuation in the spec (with CI check)
  - We are currently quite inconsistent in the spec, we sometimes forget
    curlies, …
  - This PR adds some code that checks the language and enforces the punctuation
    to adhere to our own rules

## Add 'extensions' to request (5m, Benjie)

- [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/976)
- Aim: advance to RFC1, or reject to RFCX.
  - The GraphQL Over HTTP spec needs to specify the extensions key for requests
    - Example Apollo SHA256 for persisted operation
  - Should this be in the main spec?
  - Lee’s initial thought was that we don’t need it as the spec doesn’t rely on
    it.
  - The main concern with that is that every transport spec needs to redefine
    this concept for request.extensions
  - Matt suggested a middle spec that defines more clearly how transport layers
    could work
