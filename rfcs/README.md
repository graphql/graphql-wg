# GraphQL RFC (request for comments) Working Documents

The files found here are collaborative notes exploring various proposals for advancing the GraphQL specification. Documents included in this directory imply no specific approval or support nor are any proposals required to create a document here.

## Disclaimers

* Documents included in this directory imply no specific approval or support for inclusion in the GraphQL spec.
* Documents here may be historical or out of date.
* An active GraphQL RFC may not be documented here; there is no requirement to do so.

## Contributing

Pull requests are encouraged. New documents and other non-destructive changes may be merged with a low degree of scrutiny and minimal review.

That said, please follow these suggestions:

* New proposals should be presented in a [working group meeting](../agendas). Submitting a document here is not sufficient or required to introduce a new proposal.
* Favor documents which define a problem and explore a solution space rather than propose a specific change. The intent of documents found here are to help ask and answer questions to build confidence and advance an RFC.
* A template is provided [here](./TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point for new RFCs.
