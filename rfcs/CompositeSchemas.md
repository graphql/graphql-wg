# RFC: GraphQL Composite Schemas

There's a _lot_ of different ways of combining multiple GraphQL schemas together to form a larger composite schema, and the wide variety of options can make it challenging to design schemas in a way that will be easy to compose later. To name but a few approaches:

- Schema merging and stitching (various implementations in many languages)
- GraphQL modules and other "extend type"-based approaches
- Federation (Apollo's v1 and v2, Mercurius, WunderGraph, Hot Chocolate, etc)
- Hasura's GraphQL Joins
- Atlassian's Nadel

Though these are all separate solutions to similar problems, there are various concerns that most of them have to consider:

- Identifying the schemas to join
- Discovering/defining the relationships between the types/schemas
- Schema manipulation to avoid conflicts (e.g. renaming types/fields)
- Resolving questions around type "ownership", redundancy and/or sharing; detecting conflicts
- Detecting breaking changes
- Actually fetching the relevant data, and combining it to fulfil the GraphQL request
- Managing composition metadata with respect to handling the above concerns
- etc

It feels like it would be of benefit to the ecosystem at large if there were a shared specification that covers a few of these needs.
